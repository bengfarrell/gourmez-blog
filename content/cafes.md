<h1>Cafes</h1>\
For The Gourmez, the terms cafe, coffee house, and coffee shop are used interchangeably. When I'm referring to a business as one, I generally mean that they offer espresso drinks in addition to drip coffee, and that coffee beverages are a focus of their menu. They may also have a fantastic food menu, and if they do, you can bet I will rave about it! But I'll still call it a cafe, coffee house, or coffee shop.

I am still searching for a coffee house in the East Bay that perfectly suits my needs. One where I feel welcome to spend two hours working or reading without feeling like I’m taking up valuable table space _and_ where others can use it to relax and hang out with friends. Yes, I’m talking about the elusive quest for a third space in America! Modern cafés with their sleek counters and geometrically positioned plants can be appealing and offer great coffee discoveries, but they don’t quite hit that relaxed vibe I enjoy most in a coffee shop.

Thus, my reviews of coffee shops tend to consider all those factors. It’s a plus if they offer food or baked goods, too, but that’s secondary to the coffee and vibe.

When I want coffee, I want to actually taste the coffee, rather than sugar and milk. And so, I do not visit boba shops often, nor bigger coffee chains. But I will absolutely order a mocha when I have a sweet tooth, especially one that also uses orange flavoring (Café Borgia, I love you!). I prefer oat or almond milk, because I’m not big on the taste of dairy—ice cream and cheese exempted, of course. If I’m getting anything where the foam matters most (cappuccino, macchiato, etc.), whole milk is best, as long as it's European-sized.

Why yes, I do have coffee opinions. 😁 

At present, a café au lait is the drink I’m most likely to order at a new-to-me café. It’s easy to make, just equal parts steamed milk and drip coffee, but I’m often surprised by how few baristas are familiar with it. If I burn my tongue when taking a first sip, I also consider that a demerit ... but I  recognize that a bunch of you weirdos out there prefer your beverages boiling. 😉

In my posts, I will note if there are outlets available, whether it’s okay to hold a conversation or if the café is a quieter spot, and how much seating is generally available. Have a favorite coffee house? I’m happy to check it out!
