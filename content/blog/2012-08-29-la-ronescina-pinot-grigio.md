**La Ronescina Pinot Grigio** Collio, Italy

This white wine smells mildly of cantaloupe, but no other scents jump out at me.  That’s probably because it’s extra chilled, which dulls the aroma — my bad. It tastes dry at first, but a sweetness swells up in the middle of the glass. The notes are vanilla with burnt edges, green apple, and more of a Santa Claus melon than cantaloupe. In other words, the melon flavor is timid. Overall, the wine tastes like an apple dipped in caramel that was left a little too long on the stovetop.

It’s pretty standard but tasty for a pinot grigio. If you’re a fan of this varietal, you’ll like this. If you’re like me and like to be surprised by your wine, then you may prefer to pass it on by.

[Colin Blogs](http://colintalcroft.blogspot.com/2011/08/wines-im-drinking-2009-la-ronescina.html):

A typical, very pale straw color, pretty in a well-chilled glass. Melon and sappy scents on the nose. A hint of lime. A suggestion of toasted grain. A little honey perhaps. Overall, fairly fresh and attractive. Quite tart on the palate with some fruity sweetness on the mid-palate followed again by a rush of tartness and then a delicate lingering finish with hints of nuts and an attractive slight bitterness at the very end. A trifle too tart perhaps, but at least this has some flavor and it's clean and refreshing with a little nuance. . . . Not complex or profound, but quite acceptable light summer wine.

[Eating with Bob and Suzette:](http://eatingwithbobandsuzette.blogspot.com/2012/02/february-14-2012-food-shopping-and.html)

It was minerally and dry with just a hint of fruity sweetness. After a few minutes, the mineral, tannic flavor subsided and the sweetness shone through . . . I think it is the best bottle of Pinot Grigio I have tasted for under $20.00.
