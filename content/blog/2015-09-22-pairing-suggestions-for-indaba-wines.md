Last week, I posted about [the Cape Classics National Braai Day contest](http://thegourmez.com/2015/09/18/cape-classics-national-braai-day-contest/) running through September 28, 2015. As promised in that post, here are my reviews of two affordable, and food-ready, Indaba Wines to help you on your quests to compose a winning entry, and most importantly, have a tasty, tasty, fire-cooked braai meal. **Obligatory disclaimer**: Both of these wines were provided for free from Cape Classics as part of a media braai kit.

Oh, Rub with Love peri-peri rub, I wish I could use you in time for this contest, but alas, it's not meant to be with my current travel schedule. Someday soon, you will find your magical pairing with a beautiful grilled leg of lamb or half-chicken --though not at my place, as I do not own a grill. Who wants to invite me over? ;)

I do have a couple of magical pairings for those of you with the time to grill and to pick up a bottle of Indaba Wine over the next week. For **the 2014 Mosaic**, I recommend game meat in ground form, perhaps in sausages or kofteh. Here are my full thoughts:

For my rating system, that earns an [![rating_avocado1](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2009/02/rating_avocado1.gif)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2009/02/rating_avocado1.gif)

And here are my thoughts on **the 2015 Chenin Blanc**, which I think would go smashingly well with dessert--and yes, you can definitely bake dessert on a grill! It also has potential as a contrasting match with smoked, oily fish:

For my rating system, that earns a [![rating_chicken11](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2009/02/rating_chicken11.gif)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2009/02/rating_chicken11.gif)

So go get some game meats or Omega-3-filled fish and get grilling and smoking! Good luck!
