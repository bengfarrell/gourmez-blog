**Yorkshire Hathaway** Beyu Caffe, Durham [Website](http://www.beyucaffe.com/) $6.50

![](http://www.thegourmez.com/gourmez/photos/beyucaffe12.jpg)

This hot coffee drink came with butterscotch, coffee liqueur, Irish cream, and whipped cream on top. I didn't realize it was a hot drink when I ordered it (the whipped cream should have tipped me off there), but I ended up enjoying the warmth despite our hot summer air-I must be ready for fall because air conditioning's been making me feel chilled the past couple of weeks!

The Yorkshire Hathaway was a solid coffee cocktail offering, especially because the butterscotch had just a hint of presence. Tasty and simple.
