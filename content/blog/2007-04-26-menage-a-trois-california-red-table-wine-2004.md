**Menage a Trois** Other words on the label: Folie a Deuse, California Red Table Wine 2004

Inexplicably, there are only two gleeful nymphs prancing about on the label of this blend of zinfandel, merlot, and cabernet sauvignon. The nose is full of pepper with what seems to be only a hint of rose at first, but which quickly becomes stronger. It is a medium acidity wine. Orange is the first flavor to come out on the sip. A tart and under ripe berry comes into play next. Rose is also in the mix but not as strongly as in the nose. This is a very dense wine, completely unlike what I expect when a wine is labeled as a table wine. It is an interesting experiment but not great for drinking.
