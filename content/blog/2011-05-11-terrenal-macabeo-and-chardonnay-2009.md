**Terrenal Macabeo and Chardonnay 2009** Carinena, Spain

The nose of this wine reminds me of donut peaches and a certain friend from the produce department at Safeway that used to always cut me samples of them. The taste is not nearly as exciting as that whiff or that memory.

This is my first experience with macabeo, and because it’s in a blend, I don’t have much to say about it. The chardonnay notes are strong, which dominates my opinion of this wine; I think I’ve learned that chardonnay, unless it’s heavily oaked, does not appeal to me. Perhaps the macabeo adds some of the fruity notes, but honestly, it’s not much other than unripe kiwi. I attribute the creaminess and the thin vanilla note to the chardonnay.

It’s acidic, pretty bland, yet absolutely drinkable. Alas, I’m not apt to buy it again.

Slightly tart with moderate intensity of flavor. Pleasant.

_Note from t__he Gourmez: That’s all I could find, though I learned this is a kosher wine_ _like its [tempranillo and garnacha brother](http://www.thegourmez.com/?p=2658)__, in case you were looking for one._
