My next Localwise blog post is up! On the menu this time? Different types of [burgers to be found in the North Oakland](https://www.localwisejobs.com/blog/a-north-oakland-burger-locator/) area. Your teaser:

> North Oakland has as many different types of hamburgers as there are cravings for them. Any burger lover knows an upscale restaurant’s offering is a different creature than what can be found at a shack or the local pub. But different doesn’t necessarily mean better. Each sandwich out there fulfills a specific niche of burger desire. Purists may insist that quality of meat is the only relevant factor, but I believe every ingredient of a burger contributes to overall satisfaction.

And of course, the real teaser:
