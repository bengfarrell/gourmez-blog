The most unique sake I’ve had thus far, the “Ine Mankai” sake from Mukai Shuzo brewery uses an ancient variety of Murasaki red rice from Japan. The brewmaster named it “Ine in Full Bloom” after her own hometown of Ine.

I ordered two bottles of this sake over a year ago, after having first tried it at Daytrip (now [Daytrip Counter](https://www.daytripcounter.com/)), an Oakland restaurant. I fell in love with it on first sip, and I drank the first bottle right away when my order arrived. So this one has more age on it as I bid my time before giving it a full review, savoring the anticipation of its return to my glass.

# Thoughts on Tasting “Ine Mankai” Mukai Shuzo Sake

*Most memorable flavors?* The nose is full of yeasty cheese and water crackers. Tasted at room temperature, this smooth-bodied sake reveals light notes of strawberry and lychee, mild blue cheese, water crackers, and a wonderfully lingering finish, maybe with a hint of bacon. There’s so much to explore.

Tasted chilled, toasted nut notes appear—hazelnut, with subtle chocolate.

*Image conjured up?* The bougiest charcuterie board you can think of. It’s not just slices of cheese and meat. It’s toffee nuts with hardened sugar drips. Each meat cured to just the right combination of smoke and spice. Cheeses chilled so they remain tantalizing in the hot sun. Fresh herbs sprinkled on top.

*What would I pair it with?* Well, a charcuterie board.

*What* did *I pair it with?* A cooling breeze on a sweltering day.

*Would I drink it again?* It’s been painful to wait to drink this bottle until I had time to give it a proper review. 😉 So the answer is yes, yes for sure.

*At this price range, \$50–\$90?* At the lower end of that range, heck yeah. But once we’re over \$70, I’d have to *really, really* want it. With tariffs, that may be the more realistic price now, but I’d shop around a while before accepting it.

*Reviewed August 2025.*
