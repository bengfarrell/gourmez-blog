The smell of this port is unappealing, like glue. Luckily, I already know it isn’t a bad bottle, because I used it in a cranberry curry sauce the other day, and there was no sign of foul tastes, so I’ll carry on past the nose---okay, I’d carry on past the nose regardless. When drinking, there’s a brief citrus burst at first, then fig takes over and an intense brown sugar taste swells up. A dash of creamy milk chocolate and a hint of coffee are also there, but they are so fleeting, I can’t really call the wine complex. It’s a pleasant port to drink even if it could use more depth. Luckily, it tastes nothing at all like the nose, so swill away!

Over the last weekend we opened a bottle of this dark, rich, ruby goodness. I thought it was quite tasty . . . A good full bodied Port like the [Quarles Harris](http://corkd.com/wine/view/50062-nv-quarles-harris-ruby-porto) does have somewhat of a sedative and calming effect on me as well. By Tuesday night, I was enjoying sips of the final glass, savoring its sweetness. It was all of about $12, reasonably priced. I'm not a Port snob, "it'll do".

After chilling for a while, this is the perfect late-night port. It lasts at least 2 weeks refrigerated and never lost its raspberry/blackberry flavor which comes close to hazelnut on the finish. I believe it was very cheap and it has surprising depth for such a youthful wine. It's not something I would show-off or drink as an aperitif, but it's great after 4--5 glasses of tannic red wine. It is bright and fruity.
