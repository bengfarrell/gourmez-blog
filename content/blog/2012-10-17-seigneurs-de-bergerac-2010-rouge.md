**Seigneurs de Bergerac 2010 Rouge** Bergerac, France

This red wine blend of French varietals has a nose full of leather and strong, jammy plum and cherry. Some vanilla rises up as well when sniffing. When sipping, it strikes me as very smooth with plenty of spice and chocolate. It comes across as Mexican in savoriness, like eating an enchilada with plenty of toasted onion, but there’s berry and stone fruit rather than tomato. It’s pretty dry but also pretty tasty.

The Seigneurs de Bergerac Rouge is not overly complex, but it’s a good, everyday red.

THIS STUFF IS AMAZING FOR THE PRICE. It is all the red currant and cocoa flavors that Bordeaux gets. This vintage is full and lush with so much going on. A gulping style Bergerac that drinks like velvet with ripe Bordeaux flavors.

Medium bodied, aromatically superior to most of the reds we’ve tried from this area, especially from this vintage. Starting out its bouquet reveals black currant and tar moving into black cherry spice further down in the glass. The palate is dry but soft, holding mild tannin and a very pleasant texture.

The color is a beautiful reddish purple. The nose is very fruity — like raspberries on the vine — and inviting. This is a full-bodied, luscious wine with silky tannins. In the words of one of our readers, “dangerously drinkable!”
