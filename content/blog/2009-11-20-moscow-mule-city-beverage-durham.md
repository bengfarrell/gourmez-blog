**Moscow Mule** City Beverage Woodcroft, Durham [http://www.citybeverage-durham.com/](http://www.citybeverage-durham.com/)

This drink was a mix of vodka, ginger ale, and lime served on the rocks in a short glass. The ginger ale and lime combined well with each other and with food. The vodka was undetectable, which is fine since vodka isn’t supposed to have much of a flavor (but secretly, I prefer that it does). This was my first Moscow Mule and I can’t say I found it particularly interesting but it was certainly drinkable.
