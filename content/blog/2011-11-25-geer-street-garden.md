Geer Street Garden opened last spring, and it’s been a welcome addition to this fast-expanding area of town. Located in an old gas station, it’s a pub with a great beer list featuring plenty of local brews and a menu full of pub fare and seasonal menu items like sweet potato soup. The interior is pretty brick walls, a few booths inside the door, and a U-shaped twist into the small bar in back.

The lack of inside seating is a bit of a pain if you’re looking for a table on a crowded night, but outside is an appealing beer garden, complete with heat lamps, rows of blond wood benches, and lots of seating. The beer garden is definitely the draw here. Also popular is the Pile, a mass of French fries piled up with fried chicken bites, cheddar cheese, bacon, gravy, and a choice of two of their several fancy sauces that range from a sriracha and mayonnaise combination to a cheddar cheese dip .

It hits the spot if you’re looking for a greasy snack late at night, no question. Also good is the Corn ‘N Oil cocktail, [which I reviewed](http://www.thegourmez.com/2011/08/corn-n-oil/) a while back.

Geer St. Garden’s salads have been building up quite a fanbase, and I tried their cobb recently. It was refreshing and crisp. The quality of ingredients gives it a nice edge over your standard cobb.

On my most recent visit, I went for their simple, pasture-raised burger instead.

It was a satisfying burger, but I doubt it’s up to snuff for true burger aficionados (I am not one). That’s a huge pile of fries to go with it, and they are tasty, served with skins on and perhaps a little more limp than I enjoy my fries.

My friend had the rueben sandwich on that occasion, and she was pleased with it.

I would call best suited for a late night end to the evening or after-work dinner and drinks. I wouldn’t necessarily go there for a dinner destination spot; it’s lacking a little oomph to me to be a draw beyond a casual place to stop when you’re out.
