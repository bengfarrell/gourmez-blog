For those of you who keep up with the local food scene, the closing of Fins and eventual opening of bu\*ku is already old news. But I just wanted to comment on it anyhow, because I'm so intrigued by Chef D'Auvray's plan for the space and am really interested to see how it turns out.

First, let me say that I loved Fins. I only tried it once, during SparkCon last September, but as you can tell from [my review](http://www.thegourmez.com/?p=561) then, I was quite taken with the beautiful decor and delicious food. The cocktail needed some work, but hey, I can only be so picky. Needless to say, hearing (from [VarmintBites](http://varmintbites.com/2010/01/13/fins-to-become-bu%E2%80%A2ku/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+wordpress%2FVarmint+%28VarmintBites%29) via NewRaleigh)that I would not be able to eat there again was disappointing, okay, nearly devastating. But gosh darn it, the plan for [bu\*ku](http://www.bukuraleigh.com/index.htm) sounds fantastic!

That plan is a focus on street food from across the globe, that will undoubtedly be taken up a notch in sophistication but not too much in price. It sounds like the new place will be a boon for downtown Raleigh lunch diners, who probably weren't going to shell out the clams needed for regular dining at Fins.

And there's going to be dim sum! I'm going to weigh in now and declare, though I know it might not be "authentic" enough for some this way, that I'm much more likely to try their dim sum if there are tags that accompany the various dishes on carts so I know what I'm pointing at. I want to know what I'm eating. Should a foodie not admit that?

Good luck with the new venture!
