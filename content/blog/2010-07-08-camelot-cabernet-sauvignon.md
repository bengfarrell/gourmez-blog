**Camelot Cabernet Sauvignon**

California

What's that, you say? Where's the year? No vintage for you who are so conditioned to expect silly information such as dates with your wine. No, Camelot Cabernet Sauvignon does not wish for you to predispose your tastes with preconceptions of what years might make a good wine. You must drink their wine blindly. Since I always drink blindly, because I don't have any clue what years were good years (that would take research!), it isn't a problem for me.

This yearless wine is  . . .  drumroll . . . anticipation building . . . very, very simple. Not all that far from grape juice, honestly, but not in the cloyingly sweet way that some unsophisticated bottlings can be. Its nose is of plumped currants, tobacco, and a hint of chocolate.

It tastes mild and clean with but a small burst of tannins. Light-bodied, a bit of herb in the aftertaste, which I'll call oregano. Smooth cherry mostly. Chocolate hints. I think it's very approachable for newbies, but if you've been exploring your palate for a few years like, oh, me, then it doesn't hold much to keep your interest.

  Other Bloggers' Thoughts:

On the 2007 vintage from [Decanting](http://www.wine-road.com/blog/?p=371):

The wine has a pleasant dark fruit and dried leaves aroma, with dark berry flavors. The alcohol (13.5%) and tannins are balanced with the fruit. Of the two wines I tasted (the other being Red Diamond 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon), this had softer tannins. There is also light oak flavoring. All-in-all this is a fruit-forward wine that is very pleasant.
