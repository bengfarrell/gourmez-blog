**Fuerza Blancos 2009** Mendoza, Argentina

For the record, I'm drinking this white wine blend very chilled, which can lessen the potency of the nose and flavors of the wine.  I smell apple and vanilla.  It tastes of apple also. It's acidic, which makes it seem peppery. Caramel notes are present and some herbal quality, perhaps oregano. There's a white chocolate aftertaste with some floral undertones.

I enjoy all of the differing layers to it, but none of them stand out so I won't be rushing out for more.

Pears, with slightly green aromas. This wine has good acidity and body, but a short finish. It's pretty good for $4. Not complex, but certainly not that bad.
