I tried this intriguing cocktail during my first show at the Great American Music Hall, which is an intimate space for a concert. Even the back of the venue doesn't feel far removed from the musicians. Plus, the gorgeous architecture is worth a visit all on its own — if only they allowed SLRs into a show, I could prove that to you.

But this post is about the liqueur, not the ornate chandeliers or the music. This drink is only one of many options on the GAMH's long list. Boy, do I love a proper cocktail list at a rock venue.

The Absinthe Makes the Heart Grow Fonder is made with Kubler Swiss absinthe, Crater Lake gin, simple syrup, and rose water all shaken up and topped off with Domaine de Martinolles Vergnes Blanquette champagne. The coloring is an attractive lemon yellow that looks awesome tinged with the glow of blue stage lights. Bubbles take over the first sip, followed quickly by the alcohol heat. Surprisingly the gin takes a back seat to the absinthe and champagne. The rosewater is barely noticeable – I'd double it to make an impression. Overall the drink's ingredients seem at odds with each other. Drinkable but in need of further refinement.
