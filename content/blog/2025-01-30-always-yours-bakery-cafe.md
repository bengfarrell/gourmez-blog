*The Vibe:* Always Yours Bakery Café is tucked into the center island of the Castro Valley Village shopping center. It's one of the spots where I've become a regular customer since moving back to Hayward but haven't done a proper review of them yet. So here you go!

Owned by baker Natalie Wong, the shop's primary product is beautifully made macarons, including a rotating selection of quirky "character" macarons decorated with an amazing level of detail.

In addition to macarons, Always Yours offers ube crinkle cookies, boba-style drinks, rotating cake slices (including Basque cheesecake and souffle cheesecake!), pastries, and beautiful custom cakes.

The bakery café boasts a kawaii aesthetic and lots of soft floral and marble-like décor—perfect for a selfie. They offer Happy Hour specials during weekdays, so be sure to check them out to see what the current deal is. They were running half-off drink specials with a \$10 purchase in the summer that I certainly took advantage of.

# My Take on Always Yours Bakery Cafe

*The Food:* The "character" macaroons are simply exquisite, but their regular macarons also display artistry and vivid coloring.

Their flavors are light but luscious, with options like jasmine milk tea, fruity pebbles, chocolate hazelnut, and black sesame. Plus, regular macarons are a little cheaper than their decorated siblings, which feels like a deal. I've liked all the ones I've tried, but the passion fruit is a personal favorite.

I've also twice had the Always Yours Oreo choux bun.

If you are a cookies and cream lover, you have to get this pastry! It can easily fill a whole human palm, and the choux filling is just delicious.

How about cakes? I've had the earl grey tres leches.

Admittedly, I'd have liked more tea flavor in the cake, but that's often my conclusion when ordering tea-flavored desserts, so it may be a "me" thing rather than a "them" thing. Plenty of milky creaminess throughout, so it fits the tres leches bill well. The souffle cheesecake is good, but I do enjoy the macarons more.

Always Yours beverages are also a delight! I don't get them often, because I have a hard time talking myself into sweet, milky beverages when I'm already having dessert.

That one is a tea crème latte topped with salted cream cheese. Nicely balanced, though definitely decadent. I prefer the lychee spritzer with just fruit puree, mint, seltzer water, and maybe light sugar. Very refreshing!

*Would I Go Back?* Absolutely! If anyone wants to try the next Always Yours tea service with me, please let me know. It's a cute space, with beautiful food, which makes for a feast for the eyes and sweet teeth.
