**Red Guitar 2005 Navarra** Other words on the label: Denominacien de origen Old Vine Tempranillo Garnacha

The label has a warm orange background with dancing stick fingers, one of which plays a red guitar. There's also a floating bull's head. You read that right-a floating bull's head.

The wine smells of cinnamon and ancho chile powder. It is moderately acidic, probably from the taste of tart raspberries. There's also a strong flavor of, wait for it...cinnamon and ancho chiles. Oh, and there's also some vanilla and eucalyptus in the mix.

Flavorful and intriguing.
