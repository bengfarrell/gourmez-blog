**Monty Python Spritzer** Nantucket Caf√©, Durham [Website](http://www.nantucketgrill.com/fayetteville.htm)

![](http://www.thegourmez.com/gourmez/photos/elderflower 002.jpg)

This was a simple bubbly cocktail, served with lots of ice. Prosecco, St. Germain elderflower liquor, and a dash of club soda united to create a drink with a mild beige color near the bottom. The sweet, floral flavor of elderflower was the most present component - perhaps a bit too present. The prosecco lent a nice dryness and between it and the club soda, the carbonation was at a good level to accentuate the flavors rather than overwhelm them.
