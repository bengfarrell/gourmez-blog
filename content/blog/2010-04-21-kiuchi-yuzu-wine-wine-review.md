**Kiuchi Yuzu Wine** Japan

![](http://www.rebeccagomezfarrell.com/gourmez/photos/yuzuwine.jpg) Yuzu is a citrus fruit native to Japan. I've never tried yuzu wine before, or even yuzu for that matter, so this glass will be my first impressions of both.

The color is a pleasant gold with some peach highlights. The nose is strong, sweet, and reminds me of peach again. Or perhaps the smell is of yuzu? Imagine that.

For me, this is definitely a dessert wine. It is very pleasant and complex. The alcohol seems strong at first, but it mellows quickly and is followed by a smooth, honey flavor, then lots of different fruit notes: tangerine, lime, kiwi. It's a thin-bodied wine, which gives it character as so many dessert wines are quite heavy. I found it light, airy, and delicious and can't wait to try it in cocktails from my Japanese cocktail book.

Other Bloggers' Thoughts:

Yeah, about those . . . none were found. There's mentions of it out there, but nothing I'd call tasting notes or a review.
