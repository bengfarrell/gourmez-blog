**Amelia Café** 905 West Main Street Brightleaf Square, Durham [www.ameliacafe.us](http://www.ameliaface.us) Food: $3-11 Desserts: $2-6.50

Amelia Cafe is an appealing spot for lunch or dessert if you are in the Brightleaf area.

The atmosphere is relaxed but sophisticated with smooth jazz playing and very comfy leather chairs at their tables.

They offer candy, sweet and savory crepes, gelato, and desserts all day but their sandwiches, soups, and salads are only available from 11-2.  Espresso drinks, smoothies, shakes, beer, wine, and cocktails are all on the plentiful beverage menu.

Their setup is confusing at first: if you are eating in, you should grab a seat and you will be waited on; if you are taking out, then order at the counter, but you will still need to look at one of the menus at the tables if you are looking for something not in the expansive display cases.  Be careful if you do look at the cases; I dare you not to try one of their beautiful desserts once you have.

Or the gelato, which looked amazingly creamy.

As I didn't realize crepes were available all day due to my confusion about how and what I could order, I opted for the tomato-topped focaccia round from one of the cases.

It was really flavorful with lots of herbs, squishy roma tomato slices, and sauteed green bell peppers and red onions.  I couldn't quite tell what cheeses were on top but I'd guess it was a mix of mozzarella and parmesan.

I also, of course, had to have dessert and opted for a raspberry and dark chocolate tart.

It was my idea of heaven.  Rich dark chocolate crust, with a rich dark chocolate mousse interior, rich dark chocolate swirls, and a sweet, plump raspberry in every bite.

If the crepes are half as good as the focaccia and tart, this will fast become one of my regular destinations.  And it actually stays open reasonably late, until 9:30 pm M-Sat!
