This lovely drink gets a considerable boost in appearance from that slice of pear dominating the top of the glass. The liquid beneath it is a mix of Belvedere citrus vodka, Firebirds’ sweet and sour mix, desert pear juice, and apple juice. Now, the term _desert pear_ may refer to the prickly pear cactus found in Colorado or it may be a blend of prickly pear nectar with actual pear juice or perhaps Firebirds is just getting fanciful with labeling simple pear juice—it’s unclear from their drink description. I definitely taste standard pear in the drink, along with more apple juice than I’d prefer to boost that flavor. The sweet and sour mix has a soft presence; I’d recommend another half-ounce of it to balance out the sweetness of the juices more. The Belvedere citrus vodka is excellent as a smooth liquor for the other flavors to shine in.

This is a tasty, elegant drink that needs a little pizazz.
