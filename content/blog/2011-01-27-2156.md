This is another in Trader Joe’s line of affordable, and somewhat mysterious in origin, wines bottled out of San Miguel, CA. I like an air of mystery to my wine—it just makes drinking it more fun!

The color is neon gold, if that makes sense. I can’t pick anything up from smelling it. It tastes buttery, with strong green apple notes on the after taste. Before that, breadfruit and pear make themselves known. It’s pleasing, but mild, and perhaps too highly manufactured. I’ll drink, but I don’t think it’s particularly interesting.

A crisp, refreshing, and light white wine with hints of citrus, tropical fruit, and a grassy, flinty finish. It’s simple, straightforward, easy drinking, and light on the wallet.
