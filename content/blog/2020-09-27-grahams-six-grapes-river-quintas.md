**W. & J. Graham‚Äôs ‚ÄúSix Grapes‚Äù Special River Quintas Edition Reserve Porto** Douro, Portugal

[![six grapes special river quintas edition, w j grahams, port, reserve porto, porto, douro, six grapes, special edition, river quintas, nonvintage](https://thegourmez-wpmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/09/SixGrapesSpecial-001-404x500.jpg)](https://thegourmez-wpmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/09/SixGrapesSpecial-001.jpg)For those of us who love travel, the last half year has built our wanderlust into a growing, gnawing creature of torment. Yes, my horror writer side crafted that description. üòâ But it‚Äôs apt‚Äîthe longing to visit countries I‚Äôve yet to explore is so real and so strong.

Luckily, well-crafted wine brings a taste of its mother country with it through the magic of terroir! So I was more than willing to try **W. & J. Graham‚Äôs ‚ÄúSix Grapes‚Äù Special River Quintas Edition Reserve Porto,** and with it take a journey on the Tua River in the heart of the Douro Valley in Portugal.

**_Obligatory disclaimer:_** This wine was free to me to sample for this blog.

I‚Äôve never been to Portugal, but it is high on my list of places I _must_ visit, and not just because I adore Port. Though let‚Äôs not pretend that isn‚Äôt a factor. üòâ The others are the sheer beauty of the country and the chance that some of my ancestors hailed from Portugal, in addition to Spain, before migrating to the Americas five hundred years ago.

‚ÄúSix Grapes‚Äù is a W. & J. Graham‚Äôs label that I‚Äôve discussed in [a past review.](https://thegourmez.com/2017/02/24/grahams-six-grapes-reserve-port/) Here‚Äôs a quick refresher: Six Grapes Ports are made from the highest quality grapes in W. & J. Graham‚Äôs holdings, ones that might be used for a Vintage Port in times when a vintage year is declared. When it‚Äôs not, some of those grapes find their destiny in Six Grapes bottlings instead.

[![six grapes special river quintas edition, w j grahams, port, reserve porto, porto, douro, six grapes, special edition, river quintas, nonvintage, tasting notes, wine review, port review](https://thegourmez-wpmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/09/SixGrapesSpecial-002-403x500.jpg)](https://thegourmez-wpmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/09/SixGrapesSpecial-002.jpg)This special River Quintas edition of Six Grapes is made from such grapes. It comes, in equal parts, from two vintages from Quinta Tua‚Äôs Old Terraces vineyard and one from Quinta dos Malvedos Vinha dos Barcos. Two legendary Port winemakers, Charles Symington and Henry Shotton, crafted this wine. Both vineyards lie ‚Äúlow and close to the \[Douro\] river and its tributaries \[e.g., the Tua River\],‚Äù as the Port and Douro Wines Institute has judged necessary for producing first-rate Port. Thus _River Quintas_, as the Tua River meets wonderful wine-growing estates, _quintas_ in Portuguese, on its banks.

This Port smells of warm strawberry preserves. I find I appreciate strawberry notes more in Port than in red wine. Cr√®me anglaise and white chocolate join in. While sipping, a good amount of alcohol heat comes forward, but the strawberry is so plentiful, you can dive into its depths to soothe it. Darker fruits mingle as the wine airs: tart huckleberry and a mulberry earthiness that takes me to the stone terraces surrounding Quinta Tua‚Äôs vineyards‚ÄîI imagine those berry patches spilling over their tops. There‚Äôs an herbal element that I want to peg as annatto and fresh cumin. Those also tie my journey via glass back to the land and soil from whence the wine came.

I assure you that this medium-bodied Port leads to a much pleasanter, and less dangerous end than that story grants. All the luxurious fun, none of the booby traps.
