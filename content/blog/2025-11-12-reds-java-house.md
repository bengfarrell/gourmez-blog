## The 411 on Red’s Java House

*Address:* Pier 30\
San Francisco, CA

*Website:* <https://www.redsjavahouse.com/>

*Phone:* 919-777-5626

*The Vibe:* For a waterfront restaurant in San Francisco, Red’s Java House is about as unpretentious as you can get. The one-story building pops up right on the edge of the water and sidewalk, red lettering informing you that you’re in the right place.

Inside, it looks like the 70-year-old burger joint that it is, with old-school booths and cash register. The entire inside is decorated with an array of ancient photographs.

You’ll note on the menu that there’s a hamburger and beer combo, which harkens back to Franco’s Lunch, a 1930s business that opened for the lunch crowd on this same pier. I’m unsure if any business housed here has ever specialized in coffee, though Red’s Java House has been slinging close to the same menu of burgers, hot dogs, chili, fish and chips, pancakes, eggs, and a daily special for several decades now.

The biggest draw, however, is right outside. Pass the bar, where all alcohol orders are placed except for those beer combos, and the patio opens up to the San Francisco Bay.

Like inside, the digs aren’t sophisticated. But they don’t need to be. You can enjoy a perfect San Francisco day right there with no rush at all, just like I did on this, my first and only visit so far.

## My Take on Red’s Java House

*The Food:* I partially chose to meet up with a friend at Red’s because it’s a quick half-mile walk from the ferry terminals, and I’d hopped one over from Oakland that day. But I was also drawn to their unique burger style, one that Anthony Bourdain was known to praise.

The standard bun is not a bun at all here, but a sourdough roll. It’s extra sour, similar in taste to San Luis Sourdough. Burgers come with chopped onions, pickles, cheese, and mustard—no extra toppings available. I had mine without the mustard, but with a double patty, because it was just that sort of day. It was great! Sure, I might have tried to smuggle in a mayonnaise pack, but the burger tastes exactly as it should with a salty tang from those pickles that does a lot of the flavor work. And the sourdough roll was perfect: nice crack to the crust, lots of flavor, pillowy but also chewy inside.

My friend went for the tuna salad sandwich.

It also came with onions and pickles, served on a thicker white bread. I heard no complaints.

I did not opt for a side of onion rings, fries, or coleslaw, but did decide that a greyhound cocktail (vodka and grapefruit juice) would be my extra treat. It quenched my thirst for \$10. Hooray!

*Would I Go Back?* Who can resist catching up with a friend and relaxing over an afternoon beverage with a view like that? I am looking forward to doing just that on another gorgeous Bay day. And maybe doing some sleuthing to figure out where the “java” came into the name. Also, if you’re a sports fan, it’s a great location to have an affordable few rounds before the game.
