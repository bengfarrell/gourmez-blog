**Wild Mango Lemonade [Connolly's Irish Pub](http://www.connollysirish.com/home.html) \*CLOSED\* Cary**

This vacuous light yellow drink came served in a pint glass with plenty of ice, which often translates to a watered down cocktail.  The Wild Mango Lemonade was no exception to that rule.  It was made with Finlandia Wildberry and Mango vodkas, sweet and sour mix, Sierra Mist, and a squeeze of lemon.  I don't know if I just haven't had Finlandia vodka before but the flavored alcohol was definitely not up to snuff with only a very subtle hint of either berry or mango in the drink.  The end result?  A drink that tasted like an extremely watered down Sierra Mist.  Remind me not to order this one at the next trivia night, guys.
