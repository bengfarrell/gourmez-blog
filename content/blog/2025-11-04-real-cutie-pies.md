## The 411 on Real Cutie Pies

*Address:* 341 17th Street\
Oakland, CA

*Website:* <https://realcutiepies.com/>

*The Vibe:* A former foodie pop-up favorite, Real Cutie Pies opened their storefront in downtown Oakland this past August, in the beautiful art nouveau [Howden Building.](https://oaklandnorth.net/2012/12/28/the-architecture-of-oakland-howden-and-sons-building/)

Round the corner on Webster and 17th Streets and you’ll find Real Cutie Pies right away.

They make mini cheesecakes, each offering three to four bites worth of sweetness. Served up in Dixie-sized cups, the cheesecake custards are topped off with crumbles, fruit, whipped creams, or other toppings. At \$4.75 per cup, they may feel pricy for the quantity served, but your stomach will probably thank you for not overdoing it with a larger portion.

Plus, buying a three pack or six pack will save you a few dollars on the individual size.

## My Take on Real Cutie Pies

*The Food:* I tried Real Cutie Pies soon after they opened—so soon that hours were not set yet and I lucked out getting there right before they closed. At that time, the flavors were mostly traditional pie flavors, but they have introduced more inventive ones like horchata, s’mores, PB&J, and Hella Oreo since then. I’m sure such creativity was often on display at their pop-ups in the past!

I opted for a three pack of banana pudding, pecan pie, and peach cobbler. The cheesecake custard is velvety soft and generously flavored with lemon. All three I tried were scooped over buttery graham cracker crumbs with just the right amount of sugar mixed through them.

The banana pudding was a nice compliment to the cheesecake base. For the pecan pie, the nuts’ toastiness pleased me, as did the syrupy, jammy, filling. That one could have used more lemon to cut through its richness.

The peach cobbler had lots of nutmeg, bold peach flavor, and texture like a cream cheese cloud. I’m not a huge fan of fruit pies, but this is a wonderful way to enjoy one.

*Would I Go Back?* The pricing breaks down to a little more than a dollar a bite. But when I consider that a full slice would be \$7–9 in this area, that seems priced about right. And the small size means I can defeat the old maxim of my eyes being bigger than my stomach! I’m sure I’ll stop in next time I happen to be walking by.
