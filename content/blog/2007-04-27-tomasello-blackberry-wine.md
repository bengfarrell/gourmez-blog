**Blackberry Wine** Other stuff on the label: Tomasello Winery

This wine is packed full of flavor. It has a syrupy smell of molasses and, strangely enough, blackberry. It's very translucent and tastes mainly like cranberry juice that's been mulled with allspice and nutmeg for a long time. There's a fleeting glimpse of amaretto before the vivid ginger aftertaste takes over. Cherry and blueberry also make an appearance. You can feel it trickle all the way into your stomach.

This wine has polarity; it intrigues and repulses at the same time.
