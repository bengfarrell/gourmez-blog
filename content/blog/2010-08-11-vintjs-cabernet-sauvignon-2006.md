**VINTJS Cabernet Sauvignon 2006** Napa Valley, CA

![](http://www.rebeccagomezfarrell.com/gourmez/photos/vintjscabsav.jpg)

A pleasant wine with a good amount of flavors mingling together--the spices are in one corner and the fruits in another. Boysenberry, lots of boysenberry, with a little currant to give it a kick. The spice flavors swirl through it like a cinnamon roll, consisting of cinnamon (who have thunk?) and some allspice and nutmeg. I enjoy it much more than a cinnamon roll---for some reason, those always make me sick. It's medium-bodied, not too dry, and fun!

Black cherries and plum flavor with a slight spice.
