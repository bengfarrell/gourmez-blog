First things first: the rum-soaked sugar cane. It is both visually pleasing and an essential garnish for this cocktail. Caipirinhas are a [favorite](http://www.thegourmez.com/2009/04/cocktail-review-caipirinha-mez/ "Caipirinha at Mez") in my [cocktail](http://www.thegourmez.com/2010/05/la-kiwi-w-xyz-lounge-chapel-hill/ "LA Kiwi at W XYZ Lounge") repertoire, so I am always happy to try a new one, and having one from Calavera’s impressive bar just made sense although tequila is their primary focus. This one is made with Brazilian Clear cachaça, lime juice, and sugar ... and that’s it folks. That’s all a cachaça should be.

This one is possibly too sweet, which may come from my insistence on sucking every drop of sugar water from that cane that I can. I would almost recommend that Calavera leave out the sugar from the preparation entirely, depending on the cane instead, but I would bet that would be too strong for your average swizzler. Regardless, this was a drink loyal to its origins and delicious.
