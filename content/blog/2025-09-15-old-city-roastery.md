# The 411 on The Old City Roastery

*Address:* 22570 Foothill Blvd\

*The Vibe:* The Old City Roastery is a Palestinian-owned shop that specializes in nuts, spices, chocolates, and pantry items from the Middle East as well as Turkish delight, halvah, and coffee. Through the front door, customers find a counter full of those nuts and other snack foods in a variety of flavors, a central column of wrapped chocolates in bulk bins, and a back wall full of various goods like spices and pickled vegetables (think cucumbers, olives, and eggplants).

The chocolate selection does indeed include trendy Dubai chocolate, with full bars at \$25. I have no idea if they are from the original Dubai chocolate inventor, but reviews of them are good. Fresh strawberry cups topped with pistachio cream, crunchy kadayif (shredded filo pastry) sprinkles, and of course, chocolate, are also available. Enjoy Turkish coffee in their bright café corner, or one of a variety of canned drinks like Salaam cola and Yemenade.

The shop’s employees are happy to help explain any ingredients to clueless patrons like myself. Don’t be afraid to ask! They also offer samples of the nuts and snack mixes.

# My Take on The Old City Roastery

*The Food:* On my first visit, I went home with half a pound of cashew “party” mixed nuts and a selection of chocolates.

The crunch on the cashews was phenomenal, and I appreciated how deeply roasted they were, which imparted extra cashew flavor. I did not ask for an explanation of the three different coatings in the shop, so this is what I pieced together:

-   The red coating is spiciest and tangiest, maybe a blend of tamarind and chile pepper.
-   Orange is the earthier option, similar to the taste of BBQ potato chips.
-   The tan coating is smoky and my favorite of the trio.

All flavors made for great snacking and a great mix together.

I also chose five different types of individually wrapped chocolates.

I do not remember how they all tasted, but I found one quite good at capturing the delight of Dubai chocolate in a few bites. I believe it was labaled as a kadayif chocolate.

The hazelnut had lots of flavor and I appreciated the extra hazelnut paste inside.

I also had the plain pistachio, because I just love pistachio in anything sweet.

Based on my choices, I’d certainly shop at the Old City Roastery for chocolates again.

On my second trip, I picked up a pound of their deluxe party mix, which includes items similar to corn nuts, roasted peas, and seaweed rice crackers along with coated peanuts. The new items added a fun variety of textures, but they sometimes tasted stale. I’d opt for just roasted nuts next time, and I look forward to trying their many varieties of roasted squash seeds as well—and watermelon seeds!

*Would I Go Back?* Yes, for sure. It’s reasonably priced for nuts and chocolates, and I look forward to slowly discovering all the types of treats unfamiliar to me at this shop. And I’m trying that Turkish coffee soon! I want to kick back in one of their beautiful blue café chairs to enjoy it.
