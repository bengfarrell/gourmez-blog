Word is getting around about Papa Mojo's Mardi Gras Festivities this coming Tuesday. If I'm recovered from my fifth anniversary celebrations this weekend, you can bet I'll make this event! When else do you get the chance for a midnight breakfast buffet?! Here's the official press release:

**PAPA MOJO’S ROADHOUSE THIRD ANNUAL MARDI GRAS PARTY**

_A Taste of a True Louisiana Tradition in the Triangle_

On Tuesday March 8, 2011, Papa Mojo’s Roadhouse in invites you to join them for their 3rd annual Mardi Gras celebration. “It's going to be the best one yet,” says Mel Melton, owner and lead singer in his band, Mel Melton and the Wicked Mojo’s.

If you always wanted to go to Mardi Gras but never quite made it, or want to relive some of the memories of recklessness and wanton abandonment of a past Mardi Gras, Papa Mojo’s Roadhouse is the place to be on Fat Tuesday.

Tickets are $10 each and go on sale at 5pm Tuesday evening and will be on a first come first serve basis. This year Papa Mojo’s Roadhouse is also offering advance VIP ticket sales. Tickets are $40 and include a ticket (no lines for you), complimentary beverage, VIP seating and a special midnight breakfast buffet.

At 6 pm The Bull Town Strutters will be leading the “The Papa Mojo’s Roadhouse Krewe” as they parade through the courtyard into the banquet hall next door for a set of rollicking New Orleans street songs. Following the Bull Town Strutters, the one man guitar slinger, Justin & Nikki will have you wondering how he gets that much sound out of one instrument.

“We are honored to have E Train & the Rusted Nails join us this year,” says Mel. “They just came back from the International Blues Competition in Memphis, where they competed for best new blues band in the world.” Headlining with a hot new CD, the notorious Jim Quick & Coastline come touring through to make this a Mardi Gras extraordinaire.

As added attractions, the Roadhouse will be showing great Louisiana and Mardi Gras films by Les Blank, New Orleans artists will be offering caricature portraits, and a hoop dancer will keep you entertained. So get down to Papa Mojo’s Roadhouse and enjoy a true Mardi Gras party, south Louisiana style.

Event Sponsored by: Natty Greene’s, Harris Inc., & St. Joseph’s Historic Foundation.

Papa Mojo's has great [cajun food](http://www.thegourmez.com/?p=478) and [fun cocktails](http://www.thegourmez.com/?p=1433), so I definitely recommend it! If you're going, let me know so I can entice myself to get out for it too.
