**Basil Mojito** Elaine's on Franklin 454 West Franklin Street Chapel Hill, NC

This drink was very strong with an excellent rum chosen as the base. The basil was an exciting flavor change. Surprisingly, the drink had a bit of lemon to it, which made the whole thing taste off. Interesting, but didn't quite succeed.
