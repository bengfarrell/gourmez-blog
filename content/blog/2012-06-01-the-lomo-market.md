**The LoMo Market** Various Durham Locations [Website](http://lomomarket.com/)

 The LoMo Market started making rounds about a month ago. It’s “a team of farm luvin’ folks who want to connect customers with farm fresh foods.  If people who value high quality, local foods don’t have time to seek them out, let’s bring the food to them! We have created a new retail experience where the market is on wheels.”

In other words, the LoMo Market is for people like me who sleep in late on Saturdays and miss the Durham Farmers’ Market entirely — I value sleep more than fresh food, what can I say? Luckily for me, one of the LoMo Markets stops is in Woodcroft, about a block from my house. I can’t complain about that distance nor the hours of 6:30 pm to 8:30 pm. Convenience, they name is fresh produce on a truck.

There were golden beets, kale, scallions, cucumbers, and plenty other farm-fresh items for sale at reasonable prices last night. Farms include Uncle Henry’s and Cottle Organics and many more. Additionally, the LoMo Market stocks meat from Coon Rock Farms, Farmhand Foods, and other local producers and a variety of grab and go items from Scratch, Triangle Raw Food, and specialty items like Muddy Pond molasses. You can check out their daily wares and sources on their website.

In addition to the weekly Wednesday stop in my neighborhood, the LoMo Market serves New Horizon Church from 10 am to 1 pm on Sundays, Croasdaile from 6:30 pm to 8:30 pm on Mondays, and Trinity Park from 6:30 pm to 8:30 pm on Thursdays. They are looking to add more spots soon, so express your interest if your neighborhood wants in! The present locations were chosen because they had the most support in pre-pledged dollars in the pilot program, and you can [be a market maker](http://lomomarket.com/get-involved/be-a-market-maker/) to help your neighborhood get a stop in in the next phase, too.

I was surprised at how busy the Woodcroft stop was when I dropped by. Strollers, folks calling home for last-minute ingredient choices, and general smiles all around at the opportunity to buy local.

I think that’s a good sign for the LoMo Market, and getting neighbors to congregate is always a good idea for the community. I’ll be back.
