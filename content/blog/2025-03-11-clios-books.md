*The Vibe:* Clio's Books opened its doors just a year and a half ago, and what a wonder it is! From the enchanting nook at the entrance—

—to the many corners that entice with just the right selection of used books and inviting spaces to relax within. Being surrounded by used books contributes to the cozy experience, while those nooks and crannies add a secret-passage *je ne sais quoi*. A couch here, a table large enough for five there—you never know what you'll stumble upon.

The wooden bar with green flooring is sumptuously lit. Standard cocktails are available, and Clio's offers a short cocktail list with specials on clipboards at the bar. Hours are late afternoon through late evening on weekdays. They open earlier on weekends.

Clio's wants its patrons to connect in person, which is why they host many community-building events like book clubs, conversations with authors, and even chamber music. Phone and laptop use are not encouraged.

Does the book arrangement seem mystifying? It's chronological, based on either publication date or the time period that the book takes place within or explores. As Clio's puts it on the website, the shelves offer "a continuous timeline of human civilization that provides historical context for contemporary contingency."

# My Take on Clio's Books

*The Drinks:* I had the special spritzer of the day and was  surprised that they were  still offering hot toddies in February. I appreciate it when hot cocktails stick around as long as the cold weather does! But the spritzer was exactly what I wanted that evening, and probably more appealing as we move into spring:

Refreshing, pretty in pink, and light enough that I didn't feel weighed down by the alcohol. My friends both had nonalcoholic lime-ginger shrubs, which they enjoyed. There's also espresso and other nonalcoholic options available. A small menu of food is on hand.

*Would I Go Back?* On a busy night, it may be a pain to find seating, but you can peruse the books instead. I'm glad to see Clio's busy enough that it can be hard to find a spot. I'm certain I will be back, though not as often as I'd like, merely because I don't live in Oakland anymore. I wish they were open when I was just up the hill from Grand Lake Theater!

Regardless, I'm sure I'll attend book release parties here in the future, for friends or for my next publication. And I look forward to my next drink from the bar.
