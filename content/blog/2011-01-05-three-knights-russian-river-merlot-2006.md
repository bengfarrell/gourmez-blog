**Three Knights 2006 Russian River Valley Merlot** Sonoma, CA

Prunes and strawberries dominate the nose. There’s a crushed mint flavor that accentuates the wine’s primary notes of pepper and a bright berry somewhere between blue and boysen. Plenty of dry mouth left when the wine’s been swallowed.

Deeeelicious. Tight nose with some hints of black fruit. Little bit peppery with a juicy berry flavor. Fantastic merlot!

The merlot is light-to-medium-bodied, relatively smooth and a bit spicy, tasting of black fruit and maybe a bit of tobacco and cloves.
