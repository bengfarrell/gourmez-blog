Bay Area foodie friends, today, I get to share with you a new wine festival coming to **San Jose**! The [Festival of Undiscovered Grapes](http://www.festivalofundiscoveredgrapes.com/) (FOUG) has expanded to Northern California after two years of success in Los Angeles.

One of my wine friends runs this festival and I love the concept! Why? Because as an average consumer with a special interest in wine, I relish hearing about new-to-me grape varieties. The first few years of wine exploration introduce folks to merlot, zinfandel, pinot gris, and the handful more grapes that most vineyards devote their plantings to and most consumers drink. But I quickly found myself intrigued by the unfamiliar grapes in a blend, the ones that add smoothness or boost the floral notes but rarely get their own time in the spotlight. Learning about the history of field blends and the [Sonoma wineries that feature them](https://thegourmez.com/blog/2019-01-08-a-winter-wineland-field-guide-for-field-blends/) impressed on me the value of these overlooked grapes.

The Festival of Undiscovered Grapes gives us the chance to sample more of them, as they are difficult to find in your local wine shop. And you can purchase the wines at the event, while you still remember what you loved about them! That’s a surprisingly rare feature for a wine festival.

Over 60 different wineries will be at this event, pouring grape varietals that chances are, you’ve never tried. Teroldego? Roussanne? Valdiguie? You’ll likely find them at the Festival of Undiscovered Grapes! Maybe it’ll bring out your inner hipster again, let you fall in love with one before it bursts out onto the wider wine scene someday.

General Admission tickets (\$75) include a 3-hour tasting window of **2:00pm – 5:00pm**, a commemorative wine glass, and the opportunity to purchase a case of wine for a low shipping price of \$20. More than a case? It’s free! Plus you’ll get a detailed guidebook to the wineries and a chance to win a \$500 stay in Paso Robles.

Feeling VIP? For \$125, at **12:00pm**, you’ll have the opportunity to attend a talk from [Lodi Wine](https://thegourmez.com/blog/2021-08-05-lodi-winegrape-commission/) on the many fantastic undiscovered grapes grown in that essential California wine region. Then your tasting window opens at 1:00pm for a bonus hour. Plus, shipping charges for any wine purchases are free, and you’ll get a free food item from the event’s food suppliers, a festival T-shirt, and everything else included for General Admission attendees. Honestly, it’s a rather good deal for an afternoon of wine tasting with those perks!
