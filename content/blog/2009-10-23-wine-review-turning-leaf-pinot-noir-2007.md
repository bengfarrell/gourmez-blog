Wine: **Turning Leaf Pinot Noir 2007** Region: Germany

![](http://www.rebeccagomezfarrell.com/gourmez/photos/tlpinotnoir.jpg)

This pinot noir has a vibrant nose of Saint Anne's cherry.  Until this glass, it had been a long time since I'd had a bright, light-bodied wine that didn't make me pucker.  It's very tasty, with plenty of mildly tart cherries to plop in your mouth.  Have I mentioned that I love cherries? This wine makes me feel like I'm drinking cherry cordial straight out of Anne of Green Gables.  That can only be a good thing, presuming I'm of age and not returning home to my prude of a mother who banishes me from my best friend.

Turning Leaf Pinot Noir is not very layered but I don't think it needs to be.

> Feeling adventurous (or cheap - take your pick) I bought a bottle of the Gallo Turning Leaf Pinot Noir. Not expecting much, I was pleasantly surprised. For $10.99, I found some actual varietal character. There was a definite hint of good old Pinot funk on the nose and the mouth had the classic cherry taste I associate with Pinot Noirs from the lighter side of the spectrum. There was even a hint of tannins on the (admittedly short) finish. It went perfectly with a Greek pizza from Pizza Hotline as I watched the evening news.
