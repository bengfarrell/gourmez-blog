**You Bet Shiraz 2002** Other words on the label: Southeastern Australia

I admit it. I didn't get the joke, even after looking at the label that prominently featured two donkeys.

The smell is not attractive. It's mostly of mud and makes me afraid to take a sip. I'll drink it anyway because it was a crappy day at work and I'm in the mood for alcohol.

It's very dense and reminds me of blueberry syrup in little pitchers at the International House of Pancakes. I don't like blueberries. These are tart ones and they're on the run from an advancing loaf of rum raisin bread, which in turn is being trailed by an aftertaste of flavored tobacco. What flavor? I have no idea.

As I appreciate humor, the wine's name saves it from a mushroom. If you like blueberries, you might want to give it a try. Otherwise, I'd leave it alone. It was on the clearance rack, after all.
