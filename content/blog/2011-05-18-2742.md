**Lazurro Nero D’Avola 2007** Sicily, Italy

The nose of this Italian red smells of fig with clove. It tastes like eucalyptus leaves, fig, raisin, cranberry, and clove. Overall, it’s too tangy but an okay drinking wine. I’m still trying to figure out why it was recommended to me when I said I liked Spanish wines, but that confusion is not the wine’s fault at all.

> This wine makes me think of what I had expected Beaujolais to taste like.  It is soft and gentle, with lots of fresh fruity flavor to it . . .If you want a nice off dry to dry wine with a light structure, few tannins, and a light and delicious taste, I highly recommend this one.
