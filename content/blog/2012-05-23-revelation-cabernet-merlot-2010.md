Revelation Cabernet-Merlot 2010 Pays D’Oc, France

This French blend comes across like a Spanish wine with plenty of spice in nice proportions. Those Spaniards can go overboard sometimes, so the balance is appreciated. The fruit is lovely, bright and young with raspberry and champagne grapes prominently featured. A bit of tobacco lends depth, and the spice stops the fruit from being too sweet. Cedar and vanilla are also in the mix.

The layers of this wine work together well, creating a balanced, delightful glass.

[Cheap Wine Snobs](http://cheapwinesnobs.wordpress.com/2012/04/18/revelation-cabernetmerlot-2009/) on the 2009 vintage

> It was a bit musty and mushroomy, so I let it breathe for about 15 minutes, but it never settled down. I do not even know if I liked it . . .  If you have it with some really earthy cheese like a bucheron or camembert it would work like a charm. I will give it two stars.
