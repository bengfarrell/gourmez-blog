**Wine:** Alice White Shiraz 2006 **Region:** Southeastern Australia

![](http://www.rebeccagomezfarrell.com/gourmez/photos/alicewhiteshiraz.jpg)

_Nose:_ Candied cherry and chocolates. _Taste:_ Bright, ripe cherries and semisweet chocolate, which surprises me as a lot of the wines I've tried lately have had noses that vastly diverge from their tastes. This is a medium-bodied wine, mildly tannic, and overly pleasant. It's easy to enjoy on its own, so why not do just that?

_Other Bloggers' Thoughts:_

PB @ [The Wine Cask Blog](http://winecask.blogspot.com/2006/05/alice-white-shiraz-2005-wine-review-by.html) on the 2005 vintage

This Aussie mass produced varietal from the folks who export about 15 gazillion cases of wine to the USA is a decent, inexpensive wine. It is cherry red and full of blackberries.

In the mouth it is pleasantly fruit forward, juicy, balanced, and simple though a little layer of chocolate emerges later on, and is frankly, a decent wine and solid value at $7.

@ [PhilosYphia](http://www.philosyphia.com/index.php/2009/01/24/food/3-wines-meet-liver-at-party/) on the 2007 vintage

The Alice White is a shiraz wine of amazingly smooth flavor and palate; I was really rather blown away by how easily it slid down my gullet without stopping to zing any taste buds in particularly loud notes . . . With just the slightest hint of a woodiness to it, this extremely mellow-flavored wine just felt right in my mouth and even better in my belly.
