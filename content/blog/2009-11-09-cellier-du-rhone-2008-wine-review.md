Wine: **Cellier du Rhone** Region: Cotes du Rhone, France ![](http://www.rebeccagomezfarrell.com/gourmez/photos/cellierdurhone.jpg)

The nose of this French white table wine reminds me of kiwi and vanilla. It is mildly sweet and does taste of kiwi and vanilla, though with a mineral finish. Lending it some additional depth are green apple and lime flavors.Â  It's nice to drink a wine with this many layers but it's not as delicious as it could be going down.

> This wine hits a bit sweet on the palette right after being opened, but by day two it's dried up a bit. Strange. Hints of spearmint on the nose. Some green apple flavor hiding here. A passable wine, but nothing mind blowing.

> First sip - oh boy - really sour, I thought I blew it. This was a hostess gift wine and I should have spent more cash. By the second sip - not so bad. It is a crisp dry white wine. In an oddly triangular bottle.

> So, this is an interesting slightly sour, yet fruity dry wine that grows on you. Get past the first sip, and you'll enjoy the bottle. It is not a chardonnay, and not a voignier - it is somewhere in between. Definitely serve it very cold, because as it warms, the dynamic changes, and it isn't nearly as interesting.
