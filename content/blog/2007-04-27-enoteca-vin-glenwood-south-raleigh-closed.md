**Enoteca Vin** \*CLOSED\* Glenwood South 410 Glenwood Avenue, Suite 350 Raleigh, NC www.enotecavin.com Entrees $14--20

Being as I'd looked forward to trying out this restaurant for some time, my expectations were high and ended up unmet. If you decide to come here, beware that the sign on the door just says “Vin.” I had to check to make sure I was in the right restaurant.

The space is large, light, and airy. Orange, unappealing patterns were hung on the wall. The bar is central to the room, which feels a bit like sitting in a warehouse. I expected cozy and ended up with industrial. Oh well, a website can only say so much.

Their bread is as light and airy as the atmosphere and matched with an intriguing evoo. We started with a duck confit served with crisped potatoes and scallions over a thin slice of grilled baguette. It was quite delicious but difficult to share as an appetizer.

I had grilled salmon with a dill cream potato salad and green beans for the entree. The salad was a star offering with its flavorful sauce and perfectly cooked potatoes. The green beans were nearly as underdone as my salmon, which had to be sent back.

The waitstaff was very helpful and available but I wasn't enthused with the space and only some of the meal impressed. I'll give it another try to test out the small plates but won't feel inspired to go for awhile.
