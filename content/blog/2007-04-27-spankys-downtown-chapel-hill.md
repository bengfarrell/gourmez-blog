**Spanky's Bar and Restaurant** Franklin Street 101 E. Franklin Street Chapel Hill, NC www.spankysrestaurant.com Entrees $8--11

Spanky's has a cozy pub feel; it's a place to chill with your friends at the end of the night. However, it's likely transformed by that time into a swirling mass of Greeks from UNC Chapel Hill, so you'd best stop by after work for some drinks instead if you are not one of those swirling masses. The only detractions from the pub feel were some rather ugly caricatures of past UNC coaches and players.

The menu is mainly sandwiches and burgers but there are some entrees and specials if you're in the mood. The regular fare is dressed up some with ingredients such as gorgonzola cheese instead of American on a burger or two.

We started with the Jamaican Jerk wings on special. They were very flavorful but light on spice. In comparison with other "jerk" seasonings, I've had much worse. My main course was a helping of Thai Soba Noodle Salad. The dressing was very tasty but so heavy that it weighed down the salad itself. The dish would probably be better served without a topping of the dry, bland chicken teriyaki strips.

Mr. Gourmez had the BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich and it was very dry indeed. To be fair, neither of us are fans of the North Carolina style of BBQ nor did this sandwich change that.

To sum up, Spanky's is good for a relaxing dinner but the food is nothing to write home about.
