**Alamos Torrontes 2009** Catana, Argentina

This is the perfect white wine for me. It’s very tart with plentiful grapefruit and acidity at first, but that gets bathed and soothed with a vegetal greenness: leek? celery? Vanilla pops in with a slight tang of eucalyptus to help wash things down.

The nose is beautifully perfumed, with roses and lychee. In the mouth, the fruits show in both a citrus and tropical way, very fresh, light-bodied; this wine is all about the fruit and floral characters of the grape behind it---very nice.

[Dinitro’s Take](http://dinitro.blogspot.com/2010/07/great-summer-white-wine-2009-alamos.html)

The 2009 vintage of Alamos' Torrontes is one of the wines to consider having to make life just a little more perfect.  I tasted this the other night on my neighbor's deck to top off a long day and found this wine to be absolutely charming and delicious. . . The 2009 version I had threw aromas of flowers at my nose and followed with a medium crisp and slightly dry taste that led to a battle with my friend as to who was the getting the next glass.  We both tasted citrus, melon, and peach among other flavors in this wine.
