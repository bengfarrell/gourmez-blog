# The Scoop on Cozy Kitchen

*The Vibe:* Oh my gosh, I did not expect to take such a journey back in time when I stepped through the threshold into Cozy Kitchen.

It is such a cute little diner stuck back in the 70s and 80s for décor, complete with a giant wooden fork and spoon on the wall. There are maybe four booths, two two-tops, and a small row of seats at the counter. It’s clearly a mom-and-pop joint that operates with more efficiency than affability. Take a seat wherever you’d like, and the waitress will have a menu to you in seconds, likely without a word of introduction.

Open that menu, and you’ll be amazed at the prices. Breakfast dishes will run you up to \$13, but pretty much all the lunch items are less than \$8 (fries extra). For the Bay Area, that honestly feels like a steal. And it amuses me that American is the only cheese on the menu.

The waitress will be back fast to take your order but doesn’t mind requests for more time. The food will take 10–15 minutes at most to come out, and getting the bill is just as fast when you’re ready.

# My Take on Cozy Kitchen

*The Food:* I’ve been to Cozy Kitchen twice now, once for breakfast and once for lunch. I found breakfast to be the superior choice. I was able to substitute bacon for the ham in my Denver omelette, which is also a plus in my book. Onion and bell pepper were lightly sauteed, and the oozing American inside the omelette satisfied my diner patron sensibilities.

I appreciated the thinness of the omelette layers—props to the chef! Next time, I’ll ask for crispy bacon, though.

Toast options are white and wheat, and mine needed more butter. The hash browns fit the bill with the addition of salt and pepper. They had a good crunch on their outer layer, and of course, hot sauce made them livelier.

For lunch, I had the basic cheeseburger, and it was pretty darn basic.

No complaints about the fries (add your own salt), but the patty, bun, and toppings were all fairly flavorless and dry. For \$7, it did the job, though!

*Would I Go Back?* I may be more inclined to visit a local burger joint for hamburger cravings, but I’m interested in trying Cozy Kitchen’s crab roll, club sandwich, and other lunch options for such good prices. And a tasty diner breakfast is definitely worth a return trip! Don’t come here expecting a diner bustlin’ with old-school hospitality, but do come expecting value and a quick, satisfying meal.
