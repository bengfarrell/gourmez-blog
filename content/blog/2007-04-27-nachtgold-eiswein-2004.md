Eiswein, Nachtgold Other stuff on the label: 2004 Germany, Rheinhessen

We bought this wine on impulse at our local World Market. Ice wine is the toast of the vintner world this year and I was intrigued. I knew that ice wines are made from grapes that remain on the vine until the freeze but had no clue that meant it would be ridiculously sweet. This is most definitely a dessert wine.

It smelled of butterscotch and amaretto and seemed to drip sugar from the air. The taste was brown sugar and peach. I was afraid it would be too sweet overall, but it finished lightly.
