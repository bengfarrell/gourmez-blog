**Pineapple Upside-Down Caketini** West 94th Street Pub Woodcroft Durham [www.west94stpub.com](http://www.west94stpub.com/)

This cantaloupe-colored martini is made with Stoli vanilla vodka, Malibu rum, pineapple juice, and cream.Â  It is absolutely delicious and tastes exactly like you are eating a slice of pineapple upside-down cake, complete with the caramelized pineapple wedges.

Sometimes, there is truth in advertising.
