**Cherry-Aid** [Buffalo Wings and Rings](http://www.buffalowingsandrings.com/locations_store.php?id=069) Grace Park, Morrisville

I'm still a bit confused about what I drank. The ingredients were 3 Olives Cherry Vodka and Buffalo Wings and Rings's house lemonade. I think I made a mistake in assuming the lemonade would be fresh rather than a mix, so my expectations were higher than they should have been. What I ended up with tasted like liquid cherry Sour Patch kids. Â It was also very sweet, which tempered the sour well, but this sort of drink is the type that makes me think about how many calories I'm drinking. That's never a good thing. It was drinkable, just not very inventive or fresh.
