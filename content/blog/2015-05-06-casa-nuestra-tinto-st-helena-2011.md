Open up this wine, and you'll be with your sweetie in your private cabana on the beach, stomachs full of sticky rice and pork steamed in banana leaves. You pick up your glass and share one more smile before wandering over to the bonfire where the steel drummers play.

**Other Winos' Thoughts:**

[Wine Spies on the 2007 Vintage](https://winespies.com/sales/1019-casa-nuestra-2007-tinto-st-helena-napa-valley-red-wine)

> The 2007 Casa Nuestra Tinto St. Helena is a rich and approachable red blend that has great dark fruit spice and chocolate notes on both the nose and palate and solid structure that makes this wine great for pairing with food. This is a great pizza or burgers wine. Easy to drink and enjoy today and a structure that will allow you to keep this wine for up to 5-7 years in the future.

[The California Winery Review on the 2009 vintage](http://www.californiawinetastingadventures.net/2013/03/casa-nuestra-winery-and-vineyards.html)

> This is a dark wine with intense concentrated medium intense aromas of boysenberries, black cherries, a hint of earth, cassis and plums. On the palate it has firm gripping tannins (medium +), medium acidity and gives the impression of being seemingly “old world” in style.
