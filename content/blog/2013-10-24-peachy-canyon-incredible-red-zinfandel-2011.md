**Peachy Canyon Incredible Red Zinfandel 2011** Paso Robles, CA

The nose of this wine needs brightening, but that may be my fault for not using my aerator for the first time in a while. The scents are bound tightly together. It wants to be smoky, but it's closer to cedar; the chips are on the grill, but they aren't lit yet. Mostly it smells of unripe berries and plum. There's mild spice.

The berry is much fuller on drinking: plum and raspberry with a lollipop aftertaste. The cedar is strong and pleasant with vanilla and plenty of clove. It's a great mix of flavors that I think will improve with age. But let's be real -- I'm not letting it sit that long. Post-oxidation, the wine's edges are softened, but I'm not sure I like it better that way. Regardless, it was drunk happily without complaint.

[Now and Zin](http://www.nowandzin.com/2013/07/peachy-canyon-incredible-red-zinfandel.html) on the 2010

A 100% Zinfandel wine at 14.9% ABV, this one isn’t shy. … This Zin is medium dark in color with a pretty purple around the rim.  Brilliant aromas of blueberry dance with notes of black pepper and sage.  The palate is just as fruit-forward, with big blueberry and black cherry flavors residing on base of savory black olive.

Lighter wild-cherry red, which seems to be common for Paso Robles' Zins. Bouquet -- Big vibrant, wild blackberry galore with forest floor undertones. Palate -- Quite nice, brambly, big blackberry and green tree flavors that are both classic Zin but so well balanced, it is downright delicious … I tend not to be thrilled with Paso Robles Zins but this is really NICE … Worth seeking out.

This entry level Zinfandel from Peachy Canyon is a ripe fruit bomb. It is juicy and oozes with flavors. The flavors that jump out are red raspberry and ripe plum with notes of cranberry and a touch of oak.
