# The Scoop on Zocalo Coffee

*Address:*
265 9th Ave\
Brooklyn Basin\
Oakland, CA\
[*Website*](https://www.zocalocoffee.com/) 

I’ve long been a fan of Zocalo Coffee’s original location in San Leandro, a warm & welcoming room full of wooden panels and tables that overflows with conversation and patrons. So I was stoked to try out their second location in Oakland’s Brooklyn Basin development.

This spot has a much more modern and natural vibe, with quartz tables, brick and white walls, lots of plants, and lots of appealing artwork hung on the walls—the display was of large family portraits when I was there.

Zocalo Coffee in Brooklyn Basin has also kicked up their food service a notch, making it closer to a restaurant than a coffee shop, in truth. I did not have food on this visit, but the weekend brunches and their cocktail menu are quite intriguing.

# My Take on Zocalo Coffee

*The Vibe:* This is a great update on a first-class coffee shop, melding their community ethos with the more upscale aesthetic of Brooklyn Basin.

*Can I Work There*? Definitely. The Wi-Fi is flowing, and there is plenty of space and a number of outlets can be found if you hunt them down. I should note that I was there on a Thursday afternoon, and I imagine brunch would be much more crowded.

*The Drinks:* It’s an absolutely beautiful day in the Bay, so I opted for a cold brew & lemonade tonic. A unique combo that doesn’t necessarily go together but sure is refreshing. 

Standard espresso drinks, drip coffee, and creative lattes are also available.

*Will I Go Back?* I will definitely find this spot appealing on other glorious spring and summer days.
