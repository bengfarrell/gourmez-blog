**LaCheteau Vouvray 2011** Loire Valley, France

The nose of this white wine is subdued. Honeydew and the tickle of tannins are all I get from it. On tasting, it initially reminds me of Southern white wines with a lot of sweetness. Luckily, a healthy dose of acidity counteracts that. It's bright and buttery, and lime, green apple, and mellow honeydew notes give way to lots of rich vanilla custard.

LaCheteau Vouvray 2011 is a good, solid, by-the-book white wine. Ultimately, though, it's not my cup of tea wine.

LaCheteau Vouvray is a very tasty, crisp wine. The minute I tasted it I wanted to be outside on a cool summer evening.  Maybe somewhere I would be looking at the ocean or something. This wine is perfectly priced, which made it taste even better! It tasted like green apples, sugar, pineapple, pears, and honey. It is a light yellow/gold with a hint of green. Serve at an ice-cold temp, because that makes it taste even better!

This Vouvray is a pretty wine, feminine, soft, slightly off dry, refreshing with a hint of orange, green apple, apricots, honeysuckle, and a nice smooth finish. First sip was slightly sweet, which makes it a very good food wine.
