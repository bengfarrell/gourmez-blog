**Dellatorri Chianti** Other words on the label: denomi nazaione de Origine controllate e geratita 2004 Red Wine Product of Italy

The label of this wines tries to convince me that the winery has been around forever. It features a gold foil crest of a sea horse overlooking a picturesque Italian seaside cliff and words that speak to generations of tradition if I interpret correctly.

It smells like eating dessert on a picnic in the woods, not that I've ever actually baked raspberry tarts and packed them in a picnic basket.

The chianti is a mellow yet lively balance of fruit and wood. Rich, deeply ripe cherries make you smile when you take a sip.
