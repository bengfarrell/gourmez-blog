**Hawaiian Orchard** My Place

![](http://www.thegourmez.com/gourmez/photos/hawaiianorchard.jpg)

2 shots vodka 1 shot triple sec Juice of Â½ lemon 1 shot pineapple juice

Shake all the ingredients together and pour into a martini glass.

I loved the color of this drink, yellow as you might suspect. It was really pretty and spring-like, with the cloudiness of the pineapple juice giving it depth. The flavor was nice, too, and wavered from lemon to pineapple to lemon again. I would definitely drink it again, with the only adjustment being perhaps half the lemon juice, depending on my tartness preference that night.
