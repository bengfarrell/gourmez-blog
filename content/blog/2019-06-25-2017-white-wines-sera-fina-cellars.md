_Obligatory disclaimer:_ These wines were free samples for my review.[![sera fina cellars, sera fina wine, sera fine, serafina, amador county, tasting notes, wine review, scotto, sauvignon blanc](https://thegourmez-wpmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/06/Serrafina-Wine-01-375x500.jpg)](https://thegourmez-wpmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/06/Serrafina-Wine-01.jpg)

[Sera Fina Cellars,](http://serafinacellars.com/) founded in 2010, is an Amador County winery owned by Paul Scotto, the chief winemaker behind the Scotto family's growing portfolio of wines and ciders [(my previous reviews).](https://thegourmez.com/?s=scotto) Sera Fina Cellars focuses on Italian and Rh√¥ne winemaking styles and varietals.

I tasted all three Sera Fina Cellars 2017 vintage white wines in a single evening. Here are my thoughts:

##### [![sera fina cellars, sera fina wine, sera fine, serafina, amador county, tasting notes, wine review, scotto, sauvignon blanc](https://thegourmez-wpmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/06/Serrafina-Wine-06-375x500.jpg)](https://thegourmez-wpmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/06/Serrafina-Wine-06.jpg)Sera Fina Cellars Sauvignon Blanc 2017

The signature cat pee component of sauvignon blanc is present in the aroma, along with notes of gravel and lychee. The wine is sweet and savory with rosy pear and lychee in the glass along with a bouquet garni infusion of marjoram and sage. Yet notes of candied lemon peel dominate in a delightful way. Serve this with halibut or swordfish steaks and an herb sauce.

A thin mineral breeze wafts over honeydew melon and apple notes that grow into floral fullness. There's brisk acidity with saline undertones that linger a little too long for true balance. Try this wine with a creamy clam chowder for contrast or mussels and a vegetable broth for compliment.

##### Sera Fina Cellars 2017 Viognier

I smell granny smith and honey crisp apples that transition to overripe red delicious ones in the glass. A pleasant tickle of acidity teases right before the apple kicks in, conjuring images of a playful Tinkerbell. Minerals burst where her tiptoes flit. A butterscotch anglaise tips the wine into medium-bodied territory. It would pair well with grilled, buttery, garlic bread.

##### The Verdict

I found Sera Fina Cellars' 2017 vintage white wines to be great options at under $20 each, especially if you're aiming for seafood and appreciate soft fruit notes. The acidity is a plus. Enjoy.
