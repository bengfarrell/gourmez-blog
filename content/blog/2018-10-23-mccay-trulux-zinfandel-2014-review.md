[McCay Trulux Zinfandel 2014](http://www.mccaycellars.com/) Lodi, CA

[![McCay, trulux, zinfandel, lodi](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2018/08/Zins-2-2-400x500.jpg)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2018/08/Zins-2-2.jpg)If Anne Shirley's cherry cordial was blackberry instead, this is exactly how I imagine it. Medium-bodied with a nose full of very dark, extra ripe berries. I want to make a syrup with it and pour it over pancakes or maybe reduce it with vinegar for a tasty drizzle.

Frederic Koeppel of [Bigger Than Your Head](http://biggerthanyourhead.net/2018/03/07/a-celebration-of-zinfandel-part-one-five-wineries/)

An elegant and slightly brooding m√©lange of smoke, black tea, mocha, black cherry, and currant fruit and a loamy character that opens to granitic minerality. Excellent.

[The Frugal Wine Snob](http://www.thefrugalwinesnob.com/2014/09/09/lodi-native-project-great-idea-great-wine/) on the 2012 vintage

Complex, with many aspects of what you would expect from a Bordeaux. Beautiful fruit. Tannins, yet mouth-watering. Good finish. Licorice, pipe tobacco. Very well balanced. Raw organic cherry pie, a pure expression of the fruit and soaringly beautiful flavors. A little amber in the color. I loved this wine.
