**Two Vines Chardonnay**

**Washington State 2005**

**Columbia-Crest**

The oak is strong in this one.  And it's an excellent oak that imparts smokiness to the wine and a touch of sweetness.  It has a very clean minerality, by which I mean that there is a taste of wet pebbles that's refreshing, not too bitter or out of place. I also taste green pear with the skin on, which is the least of the flavors but a welcome splash of fruit.  This might be my ideal sipping wine for a hot summer evening.
