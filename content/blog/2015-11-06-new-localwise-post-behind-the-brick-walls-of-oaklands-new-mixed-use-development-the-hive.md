Darling readers,

I neglected to inform you that I had a new Localwise post go up a couple of weeks ago! I guess that's what happens when you're traveling the majority of October...oops.

This one is all about the retail businesses now opened and opening soon at Oakland's newest redesigned city block, [the Hive.](http://hiveoakland.com/) I absolutely loved the feel of the Hive, with lots of mixed materials that give it a modern edge while maintaining an inviting environment.  The article begins....

> Get the lowdown on [Uptown Oakland’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uptown_Oakland) newest businesses and a sneak peek of those coming soon with this quick tour of [The Hive](http://hiveoakland.com/). The mixed-use development opened its doors to customers, workers, and apartment dwellers last August. The project, led by[Signature Development Group](http://www.signaturedevelopment.com/), renovated a full city block of the historic [Broadway Auto Row](https://localwiki.org/oakland/Broadway_Auto_Row) with an eye toward preserving its history and creating a new space for Oakland citizens to flock.

[Read the rest of it right here](https://www.localwisejobs.com/blog/behind-the-brick-walls-of-oaklands-new-mixed-use-development-the-hive/)! I will also be throwing up an extra post or two with more behind-the-scenes photos of that press tour in the next couple of weeks. You don't want to get me started on how excited I am for [Firebrand Artisan Bread](http://www.firebrandartisanbreads.com/)....
