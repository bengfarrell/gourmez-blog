Cancun Cocktail Bandido's Mexican Café Woodcroft, Durham [http://www.bandidoscafe.com](http://www.bandidoscafe.com/)

The Cancun Cocktail, served in a hurricane glass, is the color of a salmon fillet.  Unappetizing description aside, it's a great drink with dark rum, peach schnapps; orange, pineapple and papaya juices.  Peach schnapps would overpower a lighter base but it serves to mellow out the dark rum here.  All three juices are easily discernable in the mix and I loved that papaya was part of it.

This drink is ideal for a beachside vacation, especially since it's as highly alcoholic as it is drinkable so that nearby hotel room would be a plus.
