Consider this post bonus material from the [Pure Leaf Travelling Teahouse](http://pureleaf.com/) event I went to in June. In case you missed it ([write-up here](http://thegourmez.com/2016/06/29/pairing-pure-leafs-teahouse-collection-with-spqrs-finesse/)),  Pure Leaf is touring the country to promote their new Teahouse Collection, and for the Bay Area, they partnered with Matthew Accarrino, the acclaimed, Italian-leaning chef at Michelin-starred [SPQR](http://spqrsf.com/) in the Fillmore.

Though all the dishes Accarrino provided were tasty, my favorite actually didn't feature tea at all. Here's the recipe, provided by Pure Leaf, for Accarino's slow roast beef.

> **SLOW ROAST BEEF and CHARRED VEGETABLES**
>
> _By Matthew Accarrino_
>
> YIELD: 6-8 servings
>
> 1-2 pounds boneless beef chuck roast or short rib, well-marbled _(Accarrino used wagyu beef for our event)_
>
> **FOR THE RUB** 
>
> 1 cup brown sugar
>
> 3/4 cup smoked paprika
>
> 1 1/4 tablespoons black pepper, ground
>
> 1 1/4 tablespoons salt
>
> 3/4 teaspoons smoked chili powder
>
> 1 tablespoon garlic powder
>
> 3/4 tablespoon onion powder
>
> 3/4 teaspoon cayenne powder
>
> Mix to combine. Rub meat with mixture generously and let stand for 1 hour. Slow roast uncovered on a rack in a 200-degree oven until tender, about 3-5 hours.
>
> **FOR THE CHARRED VEGETABLE CONDIMENT**
>
> 1/2 small jalapeno
>
> 1 1/2 garlic cloves
>
> 1/2 large white onion, peeled
>
> 1/4 fennel bulb
>
> 1 plum tomato
>
> 1/2 medium carrot, peeled
>
> 1/8 cup olive oil
>
> 1 lime, juiced
>
> 1 tablespoon salt, as needed
>
> 5 turns pepper, as needed
>
> Rough cut all vegetables to roughly the same size. Place in a bowl and toss with oil. Lay on a foil-lined tray and broil until charred and caramelized. Transfer to a blender and blend with the lime juice. If the mixture is dry, add a splash of water or tea to get it blending.

This recipe takes a bit of planning ahead, but it's ultimately easy to pull together. Letting the beef roast for that long at low heat yielded one of the juiciest, yet nicely charred, meat plates I've had in ages. And I always love a lively, toasty, vegetable sauce. Enjoy!

Come back soon, as I'll be sharing the beverage recipes from that Travelling Teahouse next week...

_**Obligatory disclaimer:** I was invited as media to the Travelling Teahouse event, which means I tried this delicious dish for free._
