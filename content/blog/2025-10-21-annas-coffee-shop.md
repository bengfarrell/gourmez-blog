# The 411 on Anna’s Coffee Shop

*Address:* 444 Jackson Street\
Hayward, CA

*Website:* I’m not sure they have one! I did find several websites that appear as though they are Anna’s Coffee Shop website, but I think they’re just pulling info from elsewhere on the web. From those sites, I can assume that Anna’s hours are typically 7:00am to 2:30pm.

*Phone:* 510-582-9185

*The Vibe:* Housed in an older, A-frame building, Anna’s Coffee Shop gives off distinct Scandinavian vibes.

But the food is a mix of American and Mexican standards. It’s a “coffee shop” in that diners often used to be called coffee shops, before the Starbucks-led third-wave-coffee era of stores that focus specifically on java. My East Bay region has quite a few of these older coffee shops, and you can still get an affordable breakfast at most of them for less than \$20, like at Anna’s. Typically, they offer drip coffee, perhaps with flavoring or iced as options.

Brown booths and tables fill the two main rooms of the restaurant. The back room is stuffier than the front room, as it does not benefit from an overhead ceiling fan or high ceiling. So if you overheat easily, this may not be the restaurant for you. I recommend Anna’s on cooler, less humid days. The patio is a nice option as well.

# My Take on Anna’s Coffee Shop

*The Food*: On my first visit, I opted for Alan's omelette, minus the mushrooms. The eggs were cooked nice and thin; I prefer that style of omelette over the fluffy kind.

More filling would be nice, but the sprinkle of melted cheese on top was just right. The home fries are lovely: cooked to a creamy, soft interior with a crumbly outer crust. Both the eggs and potatoes are well-complemented by Anna’s homemade salsa.

On my second visit, I ordered chilaquiles with red sauce, hold the beans.

Anna’s version has less crunch than I prefer, meaning they dip those chips in the sauce for longer than I would. But it tasted like a classic chilaquiles, so I was satisfied and would order it again to try their green sauce.

Their standard black cup of coffee is tasty, which is quite rare for a diner! That’s worth noting.

My husband has had a club sandwich, which fit the diner bill for that dish to a T.

I can’t report on how it tasted, as I didn’t try it. But I’d order it myself based on how it looked.

*Would I Go Back?* I’m sure I’ll visit Anna’s Coffee Shop again, likely when I want that old school diner charm with a breakfast splurge. They do have a chorizo and nopales egg plate, a rare find that I’d love to try. But the enchiladas and tacos are enticing too…. maybe I’ll make it for lunch next time!
