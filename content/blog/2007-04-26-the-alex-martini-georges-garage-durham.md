**The Alex Martini** George's Garage \*CLOSED\* Durham, NC

This drink proves that apple martinis don't have to hit you over the head with sugar. It came garnished with an orange slice and topped with foam, which I love. It was the color of sparkling cider but a bit murky so that I wondered if it was fresh pressed juice. Frangelico was the most prominent flavor. The drink could have benefited from a bit more apple in the mix.
