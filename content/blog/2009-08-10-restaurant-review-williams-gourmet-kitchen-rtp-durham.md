**William's Gourmet Kitchen** 2114 East Highway 54 Research Triangle Park, Durham [http://www.williamsgk.com/](http://www.williamsgk.com/) Sandwiches:  $4.29-$6.49 Sides:  $0.99-$2.49

William's Gourmet Kitchen is a popular spot for breakfast and lunch right where Highways 54 and 55 intersect.

Its atmosphere is definitely that of a fast food restaurant but one that is very clean, welcoming, and decorated with fun artwork on the walls (presently [Big World Photography](http://www.bigworldphoto.com/) by Lorri Honeycutt).  Free wifi is available, which is always a plus.

Sandwiches, salads, burgers, or soup are available à la carte or you can add on a side of sweet potato fries, regular potato fries, chips, potato salad or pasta salad.  I'm still a bit annoyed with myself for spazzing at the register and not ordering the nicely priced half sandwich, cup of soup or side salad, and drink combo for $7.29.  Instead, I ordered a full smoked turkey sandwich.

The bread was more similar to a square french bread roll than a traditional _foccacia_, as it was described on the menu, but I thought it had a pleasant, chewy texture regardless. The amount of turkey on the sandwich was just right, not too much and not too little.  I am often turned off when places pile mounds of meat on a sandwich and I have to pull half of it off.  Green leaf lettuce, red onions, and drippy chipotle mayo added extra flavor.  It was a solid, if not extraordinary, sandwich offering.

There were also plenty of baked goods including brownies, rice crispy treats and cookies available, if you'd like to treat your sweet tooth.  I was barely able to resist the red velvet cupcakes but my willpower kicked in just in time.

I'll be back to try breakfast, though I wish they had more than drip coffee to offer in the morning caffeine department.  But with omelets and home fries available for $5, I'll forgo the cappuccino.
