**The Cue-Tue @**

[Tyler's Restaurant and Tap Room](http://www.thegourmez.com/gourmez/restaurants/review.php?id=29&type=) **Downtown Carrboro, NC**

We ate at the Carrboro location of Tyler's Tap Room for the first time a few Thursdays ago. From the drink list, I settled on the Cue-Tue, not only an adorable name but also one that conveys both its cucumber base and its resemblance to a Long Island Iced Tea. As I'm not a cola fan, this is a definite improvement on the original.

The cucumber is fantastic in this drink and overall, it was very similar to the cucumber agua fresca I made when we had an overabundance of the veggies from our porch jungle a few years back. The blend of vodka, gin, rum, tequila, cider, and lemonade was unobtrusive and perfectly mixed.
