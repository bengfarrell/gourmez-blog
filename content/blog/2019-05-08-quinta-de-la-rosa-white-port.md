**Quinta De La Rosa Extra Dry Non-Vintage White Port** Douro, Portugal ABV 19.5%

[![Quinta De La Rosa Extra Dry Non-Vintage White Port](https://thegourmez-wpmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/05/QuintaDLRWhitePort02-333x500.jpg)](https://thegourmez-wpmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/05/QuintaDLRWhitePort02.jpg)One of my surprises at last year's [Vintage 2016 Porto Tasting](https://thegourmez.com/2018/11/27/2016-vintage-port-a-sign-of-good-things-to-comeand-good-drinking-now/) was being handed a tasting glass of Fonseca Extra Dry "Siroco" White Port. Readers, I am unashamed to admit that I did not know white port existed until that moment. As is typical for me, I became ridiculously excited at the prospect of having yet another type of wine to explore. Especially a new-to-me port. I love port. So when I was offered a sample bottle of **Quinta De La Rosa's Extra Dry Non-Vintage White Port,** I had to say yes. _Obligatory disclaimer:_ That means I paid nothing for the wine I'm about to review.

The Bergqvist family, which owns Quinta De La Rosa, [website here,](https://www.quintadelarosa.com/content/quinta-de-la-rosa-2) has been making port in the Douro Valley since 1815. Their white port comes from grapes pressed to make white wine. Brandy is added during the process. The producer recommends drinking this white port slightly chilled, but I actually preferred the wine before refrigeration.

Room temperature, this wine has the same body as ruby ports: that velvety richness envelops the tongue after first conjuring  an initial image of orange blossom water in a glass. Candied citrus notes with cinnamon and soft lemon verbena come first. There's heat on the finish, but enough sugar that you mostly forget all about it. When chilled, its body is lighter and those alcohol notes are heightened, giving the port a paprika hello.

Whatever temperature you choose, Quinta De La Rosa's Extra Dry Non-Vintage White Port provides a fun change from traditional tawny and ruby  port styles.
