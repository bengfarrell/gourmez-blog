Placido Chianti 2008 Tuscany, Italy

![](http://www.thegourmez.com/gourmez/photos/placidochianti.JPG)

This chianti tastes pungent, and not in a good way. Unripened blackberries, nectarines, apples, mild chocolate, and herbs---dried thyme, mostly---are the notes I taste. Those don’t make for a great combination. I’m not spitting it out, but it’s not really worth drinking, either.

It’s very good. Placido Chianti is a fun, light-hearted quaff with a touch of floral on the nose. The taste is dry and slightly tannic . . . very pleasant red, quite dry, with a floral (I’m copying Melody’s word) and peppery nose and a medium body. Very drinkable. I’m sure this wine is very Italian food-friendly: fragrant, pleasantly acidic. A fun discovery for $9.

Once open, some sweet, sourish note occurs with some significant red fruit. It was pretty much a simple, fruity wine that lacked complexity.
