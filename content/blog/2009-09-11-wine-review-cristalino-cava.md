Wine:  **Cristalino Cava** Region:  Spain

This is my first sparkling wine review, can you believe that? It's also, well, strange. The cava is especially yellow in color and smells of celery and chicken broth, which comes across as comforting rather than off-putting.  There's no berry to speak of when drinking it but it coats my mouth well, is very dry, mildly sweet, and savory.  Honestly, it tastes like chicken soup and I wouldn't mind drinking it next time I'm under the weather.

But it's still strange.
