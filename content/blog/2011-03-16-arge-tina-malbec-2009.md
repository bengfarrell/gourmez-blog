Who can resist a pun like this wine’s name? Mr. Gourmez won this bottle of wine at a trivia game—hooray, free wine!

Nail polish and heavy spice meet my nose, but I’ve found a nail polish smell does not always make a nail polish wine. Tobacco is prominent when drinking, with raspberries and caramelized brown sugar. The spice is much less strong than when smelling it, nor is there any nail polish taste. It’s not a perfect combination of elements and definitely needs air, but it’s pretty drinkable.

Other Bloggers’ Thoughts:

What, no other bloggers have stumbled across this pun of a wine label, yet? I’m shocked.
