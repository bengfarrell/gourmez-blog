**Stellina 2012 Reserve Old Vine Zinfandel** Lodi, CA

Stellina 2012 Reserve Old Vine Zinfandel comes from [Estate Crush](https://estatecrush.com/), a custom crush facility producing a great many small lot wines from grapes in the Lodi area of California. They sell wine from the Stellina Estate Vineyard under their own Estate Crush label.

I questioned for a moment if the bottle was compromised—the smell was that strong—but I quickly decided it was just potent after drinking it.

It's the perfect complement to a nice, juicy steak. No need to order toppings; the wine has all the necessary elements. Warmed fruit joins the mushroom and blue cheese, and pencil shavings finishes it off.
