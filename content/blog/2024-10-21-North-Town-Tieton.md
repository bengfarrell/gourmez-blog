# The 411 on North Town Coffeehouse - Tieton

*Address:* 617 Elm St, Tieton, WA\

*The Vibe:* North Town is a favorite local coffeehouse on the Yakima scene, and I was delighted to find it open on the Tieton town square when visiting my mom and stepfather recently. They opened this new location a few months ago because their primary location, The Depot in Yakima, is under repair after a fire. Lucky for me, they are hoping to keep both spots open once The Depot shop returns to business. I may be addicted to coffee and my parents ... are not. I might not have to pack my own freshly ground beans anymore on trips! ðŸ˜„

Tieton is a cute agricultural town with a burgeoning arts scene, and I am strongly in support of new cafes and businesses to keep me entertained when I visit. The cafÃ© space is bright and sunny. Happily, it was hopping all three times I went. The locals seem thrilled to have a gathering space with great coffee and tasty breakfast and lunch eats on offer. You can also buy an assortment of stationery-related goods and smaller, unique gifts.

In addition to the attractive indoor space, there are a few tables outside the storefront and a side patio. On offer is a variety of espresso and coffee drinks, teas (matcha & chai included) breakfast sandwiches, lunch paninis, and whole coffee by the pound. There are also usually yogurt parfaits, a selection of baked goods, and a quiche of the day.

# My Take on North Town Coffeehouse Tieton

*The Food & Drink:* My first day, I stuck with an iced Americano, which tasted as it should: bold, black, and smooth.

On other days, I enjoyed solidly made almond and coconut milk mochas.

I was super excited to have time to try "The Bougie" egg sandwich on one of my last days in town. Served on a french roll, it comes with a cherry tomato and red bell pepper spread, Duke's mayo, egg, cheese, and a choice of bacon or sausage.

I always go with bacon, though there's a risk that it won't be cooked enough for my liking. This bacon was tasty, and wow, that cherry tomato and pepper spread is phenomenal! Roasted, concentrated flavor abounded in each bite. Great eggs, nice, fluffy bread. I'd eat more of them than is good for me if I lived nearby.

*Would I Go Back?* I am sure hoping that I get to! In a small town like Tieton, it can be hard to sustain a business, but I was delighted to see how busy North Town was on that little corner. Fingers crossed, the local populace keeps up the support so I can visit again when I'm next there.
