**Mars and Venus Cabernet Sauvignon 2007**

**![](http://www.rebeccagomezfarrell.com/gourmez/photos/Picture051forblog.jpg)**

The nose is musty but in a good, inviting way.  It smells closest to sweet tobacco from a pipe.

The taste is complex and not obnoxiously so, like some wines that pack in too many flavors.  Extra ripe fig is the main player.  It is medium-bodied and has a nice weight in my mouth.  There is a subtle presence of blueberry but I even welcome that, which is a near miracle for me.

This dry cabernet is a pleasure to drink.  Thanks to whomever of you bought it for my birthday!
