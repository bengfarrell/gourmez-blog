This red wine has a strong nose of super ripe blackberries and red licorice. Spice rises to the forefront when sipped, wrapped in just enough fruit to tame it. It’s delicious. Anise, mild cinnamon, and a depth to it that I’m calling sandalwood. The fruit combines well with those notes, providing a wonderful platform to highlight them.

Love it.

Other bloggers’ thoughts:

There are a number of great reviews of Shannon Ridge’s 2007 Zinfandel, but that’s a different series than the Ranch Collection, so I’m not sure those thoughts would translate well—they were great, though! Thus, I have no blogger reviews to share.
