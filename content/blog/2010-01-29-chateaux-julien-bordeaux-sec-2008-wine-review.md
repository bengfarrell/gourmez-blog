**Wine:** Chateau Julian Bordeaux Sec 2008 **Region:** Gironde, France

I can't help but feel like a wine with lots of stamps and small print, as this label has, means that I'm supposed to really like it. I am, right? But I suppose I'm supposed to think that of all wines. Regardless, all the appellations intimidate me, as well as how many times I just typed the word _suppose_. My first red Bordeaux did not impress, so I try this one both assuming it will be above my wine-appreciating head and below my personal preferences.

That's a lot of expectation for any wine to handle, but the Chateau Julian Bordeaux Sec 2008 handles them all pretty well.Â  The nose is floral, perhaps lilac. The taste is very bright. Lilac is there, but also bold notes of grapefruit, cream, and a sharp herbalness that I'm dubbing tarragon. These elements combine to taste like a well-thought out marinade for chicken or salmon. Strange, I know, but quite good in wine form. I think it would go well with salty foods.
