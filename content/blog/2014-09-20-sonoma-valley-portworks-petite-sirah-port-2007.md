**Sonoma Valley Portworks Petite Sirah Port 2007** Clarksburg, CA

During my trip last spring to Petaluma, I picked up this bottle of port in a surge of jubilation that I had found a winery specializing in dessert wines (613 2nd Street in the Foundry Wharf building).

Plenty of wineries offer one or a handful of ports in their collection, but few give all their attention to after dinner drinks. Sonoma Valley Portworks makes sherry, grappas, and wine-infused vinegars in addition to port.

The typical list in their tasting room includes a sampling of everything but the grappa. Which means I need to work on getting them to offer grappa tastings too! Co-owner Caryn Reading did our pouring, and she was incredibly sweet and eager to help us plan a perfect day in Petaluma. I’m sure she’d be open to some arm-twisting…

The SVP Petite Sirah Port 2007 reminds me of biting into my first cherry cordial candy—the ones people either hate or love at Christmas time. The wine’s strong alcohol heat is akin to the candy’s syrup dribbling down your chin, a minor inconvenience endured for a sweet, indulgent treat.

I gave it a 72/100, which earns it an avocado.

Other Bloggers’ Thoughts:

There are plenty of reviews available for SVP’s ARIS port, but not for this little guy.
