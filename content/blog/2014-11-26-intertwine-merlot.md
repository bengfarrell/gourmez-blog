# Intertwine Merlot 2013 Details

*Region:* Napa Valley, CA\
*Grapes:* Mostly Merlot\
*Age at Review:* 1 year

This red wine blend is from winemaker Bridget Raymond. It needs aeration to come to its full potential. Running it through an oxidizer worked well enough for me, but a few hours out in the decanter would also be fine.

# Thoughts on Tasting Intertwine Merlot 2013

*Most memorable flavors?* The coloring is not that appealing and without aeration, the texture is grainy and pulpy. Let it breathe, and that mellows out with an intriguing finish. It’s worth drinking—I’m pretty sure I’m ordering more if it’s still available.

*Image conjured up?* It’s like biting into your first piece of dark chocolate. It’s so very different from milk chocolate that you’re not sure you like it . . . but you keep nibbling. Eventually, you’ll recognize bright cherry undertones and wonder what you did with your life before that first bite.

*Would I drink it again?* Yes!

*Other Imbibers’ Thoughts:*

Nice dark color with an enticing nose. The flavors are not particularly complex—not well blended—and the wine fights the mouth rather than enhancing the experience.

Young wine. Bet this would be much better in a year or 2! Tannic, though not harsh. Not fruit forward, or really any distinct fruits coming forward. Spicy, black pepper, smoke, leather. Nice w/ roasted peppered chicken. You will enjoy this wine if you let breathe, AND pairing w/ food is A MUST!

Dry and oaky and all together pleasant for a merlot (a varietal that is not my first love). Lots of tobacco, mocha, and graphite notes. Not super-fruity, dry and velvety with warm subtle tones that linger on the tongue and don't quite make it down the throat. She cloaks the teeth with a dark uncomely film.
