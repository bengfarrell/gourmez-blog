**2011 Green Fin Cabernet Sauvignon** California

In the tradition of Trader Joe’s wine, the exact region in California these grapes hail from is murky, but that’s all part of the mystery, right? This Cab smells of berry and nothing else. Thin- to medium-bodied, barely there sweet anise and leather notes come out right away then fade quickly. It tastes like bright raspberry and currant jams, like the fruity liquid squirting out of juicy bubblegum.

Simple, pleasant, not memorable.

[The Wino That I Know](http://thewinothatiknow.blogspot.com/2012/05/green-fin-cabernet-sauvignon.html)

At first sip, I wasn't a fan of this wine. It is a pretty full-bodied wine but not full of flavor. The more you drink, the more less-offensive it is. . . . I think it could be OK in the winter with a heavy, meaty meal, but I personally do not anticipate buying it again. Rating: 2 out of 5 stars.

[Say Cheese and Wine](http://www.saycheeseandwine.com/wine-cheese-wednesday-riedel/)

It’s tasty. It is a bit dry (I think), and it doesn’t make me make yuck wine faces. I approve.

[Bach to Bacchus](http://bachtobacchus.blogspot.com/2013/01/budget-wine-report-8.html)

This is flabby, unbalanced, uninteresting, and insipid, more like a cheap jug wine. It is not really a desert wine but is too sweet for a table wine unless it was balanced with more acid or carefully paired. It is the sort of wine that a person who does not usually like wine might like. I poured most of it out. . . . Definitely not recommended.
