**Renwood 2002 Viognier** Other stuff on the label: Select Series, Lodi

This white tastes like creme brulee that's finished with a splash of orange juice. It has a sweet and sourness to it, like a buttery mixture of vanilla, pineapple, and allspice. The smell is leafy, which doesn't at all fit with the taste, but serves to remind you that this is wine, not dessert!
