*Most memorable flavors?* Smells like raspberry nonpareils. Mulberry, tart cherry, and a cinnamon finish are the primary notes.

*Image conjured up?* Tastes like you're in a log cabin, ready for a cozy evening. The blossoming flame in the fireplace gives off cinnamon sparks.

*What would I pair it with?* I'd like to try this with butter-poached salmon and roasted potatoes. It's an out-of-the-box pairing, but I think it'd work.

*What* did *I pair it with?* A nice Saturday evening after a hot tub soak.

*Would I drink it again?* Yes!

*At this \$22 price?* It's not the first bottle I'd reach for at this price point, but the flavors are a unique combo worth trying again.

*Reviewed 8 February 2025.*
