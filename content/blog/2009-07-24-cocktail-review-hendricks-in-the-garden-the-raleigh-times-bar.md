**Hendrick's in the Garden** The Raleigh Times Bar [http://www.raleightimesbar.com/](http://www.raleightimesbar.com/)

This cocktail was a mix of cucumber chunks, lavender syrup, gin, and club soda on the rocks.  The strong, yet bland gin quickly took control from the cucumber and sweet lavender.  It's rare that I want the gin in a drink to be more flavorful but this is an exception.  A more herbal, vibrant gin would have made a big difference.
