**Modern Paloma** [Rockfish Grill,](http://www.rockfish.com/ncarolina.htm#southpoint) Durham

This cocktail---I hesitate to call it a margarita, though I think it was under that heading in the restaurant’s drink list---is made with Milagro silver tequila, Licor 43, and red grapefruit, orange, and lime juices. A paloma, I’ve just learned, is a popular Mexican cocktail made with tequila, grapefruit soda (or juice and club soda) and lime.

I really enjoy the flavors: the grapefruit, Licor 43, and tequila complement each other very well---even heavenly so. The grapefruit does lend sourness, but the sweetness of the orange really mellows it out as the drink lingers on your tongue. It’s close to a mai tai in flavor, but this is a good drink in its own right. It makes me smile when I take a sip.
