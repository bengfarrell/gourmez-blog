I purchased this wine based on its super appealing nose at a wine tasting at [Hope Valley Bottle Shop](http://www.hvbottleshop.com/) recently. It smells like brown sugar with white pepper and leather notes. I haven’t had many leathery wines lately, so that may be what appealed to me most. Drinking it is better than smelling it, because the fruit comes out nicely. I taste dark cherry, date, and fig. It’s smooth, moderately dry, and leaves you with that white pepper and some leather on the way out. It’s a lovely wine, and it would go wonderfully with steaks, burgers, or possibly a rich dessert like a bread pudding.

I think it’s fantastic. Give it a try.

Other Bloggers’ Thoughts:

Lots of bloggers have thoughts on their montepulciano d’abruzzo but the aglianico has been neglected.
