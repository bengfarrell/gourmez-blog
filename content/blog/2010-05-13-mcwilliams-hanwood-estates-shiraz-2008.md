**McWilliams Hanwood Estates Shiraz 2008** Southeastern Australia

![](http://www.rebeccagomezfarrell.com/gourmez/photos/mcwilliamsshiraz.jpg)

Curry leaves and pepper come forward in the nose. The taste is interesting: cherry, not fully ripe, is foremost on the palate, but with a spicy tone that actually reminds me a lot of Trader Joe's Cherry Cider. I can down a jug of that beverage in no time at all, so this is a good sign for this wine. The spice is mellower here than in the cider, more like a hint or undercurrent of cinnamon and cardamom that mellows out the cherry. It is medium-bodied and I really dig it.

A great go-to wine if you are a Shiraz lover. You will not be disappointed and it paired wonderfully with the Bison that I had for dinner that night. Big, rich and full of flavour!

This Shiraz is a clear, medium-deep ruby in color. The nose is simplicity itself: black fruit, spice, oak and vanilla. The wine is dry, not too acidic, not particularly tannic, not over alcoholic. My first taste was a general note of spice-it comes with this grape-bringing touches of nutmeg and clove alternating with vanilla. Blackberry, black plum and raspberry hold up the fruit end of the equation. You also get some tobacco and cocoa, with a touch of candied cherry on the finish. . . Â this is some pretty tasty wine (and at a price that usually gets you less). It presents a few basic fruits rather well, does the same with the spice, and shows intelligent use of oak. It shows no obvious artificial elements (like inappropriate sweetness, or bitter vegetal notes). If not profound, it is decidedly friendly, and honest to boot. Verdict: Satisfying

Black cherry pour with ample rich plum and black cherry bouquet full of ripe fruit. Palate---spicy front with some heft yielding to nicely integrated, extracted plummy fruit with character in an easy drinking style. Finishes with some spice and fruit galore.
