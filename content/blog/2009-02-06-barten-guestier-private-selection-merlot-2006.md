I must note that the label features a lovely piece of impressionist artwork with brilliant orange and red roads around an orchard.  I suppose it's probably a vineyard but looks more like trees than vines, so I'm sticking to orchard.

I did not discern a smell for this wine.  It is light with an initial dash of pepper, only enough to tickle your tongue.  That gives way to the taste of dried red currants and musty leather.
