## The 411 on La Ca Bakery Cafe

*Address:* 24788 Amador Street\
Hayward, CA

*Website:* <https://www.lacabakery.com/>

*The Vibe:* You can be forgiven if you think you’ve stepped inside a convenience store rather than a bakery café upon entering La Ca for the first time.

Like me, you were likely drawn inside by the great reviews for banh mi sandwiches and mochi donuts. And indeed, after steering your attention away from the immediate display of chips and other packaged snacks, you’ll realize that you’re in the right place. If that freshly baked bread smell doesn’t clue you in, the bakery cart full of baguette rolls should. And the trays of colorful mochi donuts.

La Ca Bakery Café offers a wide range of boba-style coffee, smoothie, and milk drinks to go with the sandwich or mochi donut of your choice. Nor are banh mi all that La CA Bakery Café has to offer for your lunch: tuna melts, clubs, and bacon, egg, and cheeses are available along with spring rolls, rice noodle bowls, and Korean-style corn dogs.

While the interior of La Ca is unassuming, the quality of their food is not. The line out the door should clue you in on that.

## My Take on La Ca Bakery Cafe

*The Food:* I am not an expert on banh mi, but I’ve had enough that I can truly appreciate the freshness of La Ca’s bread. Their rolls are smaller and wider than a traditional baguette, and they work perfectly for the classic Vietnamese sandwich. The bread is mildly sweet, super soft and elastic, and has a satisfying, shiny crust.

Sometimes, restaurants skimp on banh mi toppings, but that’s not the case here. Plenty of mayo, cilantro, jalapenos, daikon radish, and carrot provide the crunchy, tangy base for the sandwich’s meat. I’ve had the combo with ham, pork, and pâté and more recently, the grilled beef. Tasty marinades on the meat and those fillings make for a satisfying banh mi lunch.

I don’t have pictures of La Ca’s beverages, but I do have opinions. The mochito combines condensed milk with coffee, chocolate, mint, and cream for a tasty treat. On another day, I had the dirty matcha blend of matcha, coffee, and milk (just a splash), which added zest to my afternoon and worked, despite the unusual combination of tea and coffee in the same cup.

Mochi donut flavors rotate, with eight on offer daily. I’ve recently had the yuzu, churro, and cookies ‘n cream, pictured above. The yuzu had the brightest flavor, of course, but the cookies ‘n cream best hit my sweet spot. Good spongy texture and not too oily, which is what makes a mochi donut great.

*Would I Go Back?* Anytime that banh mi craving hits! I am curious to try the curry chicken option for it. The tasty drinks and donuts are just a bonus for me.
