**Concha y Toro** **Casillero del Diablo Carmeniere 2004** Chile

A black current tang quickly gives way to a pronounced presence of scorched sugar. It's warm milk comfortable---you don't want to stop the flavors with the threat of a new sip. There is a medium level of spice that concentrates when it gets a swish in the mouth. It's golden smooth with a nice smell of oak. Pleasant and fire cozy.
