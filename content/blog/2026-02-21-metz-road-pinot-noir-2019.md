The Scheid Family’s Metz Road label focuses on estate-grown pinot noirs and chardonnays from a single vineyard per bottling. That estate, the Riverview Vineyard, is far inland from the coast, but it absorbs the chilly winds of the Monterey Bay all the way out in the southern Salinas River Valley. Thus, wines coming out of the Riverview Vineyard are still part of the Monterey AVA.

Metz Road is named after the road that borders the  vineyard. I quite admired the embossed seal and golden eagle on the label.

## Thoughts on Tasting the Metz Road Pinot Noir 2019

*Most memorable flavors*? I decanted this wine for two hours before sampling. Its nose is full of rich, ripe berries. The color is deep purple with a brown-tinted sheen of aging. It's medium-bodied, with a cold-climate feel to it, one that recalls fog, salt, and hugging your sweater a little closer.

The 2019 Metz Road Pinot Noir tastes of raspberry jelly nonpareils that have been touched with a blowtorch for slight caramelization. Also of plum, apricot, horehound candy, spicy licorice, and mace. It finishes with appealing kumquat tannins.

*Image conjured up?* Drinking the 2019 Metz Road Pinot Noir is like buying candy at an old nickel store, and being pleased, though it’s both more savory and less sweet than you expected.

*What would I pair it with?* A toasted peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Or a fig, brie, and prosciutto pizza.

*What* **did** *I pair it with?* Potato chips and a cooling breeze on a warm California winter’s day.

*Would I drink it again?* Yes.

*At this \$36 price?* I’d prefer it about \$10 cheaper, honestly. But I’d be interested in trying it again in another 5 years to see what else additional aging might contribute to the glass, so maybe.
