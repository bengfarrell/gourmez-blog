For our third day in London, we had a theme: FOOD. I didn’t actually do much tasting of food, but I did smelling and looking galore. London has many markets, and one of the best is the Borough Market, located in Southwark on the south side of the Thames. It’s a blend of produce, meat, and cheese sellers and purveyors of a variety of ready-to-eat munchies. We rendezvoused with Scott, Zahir, and Sanaz after a little while and continued the market tour. Let the food show begin!

That last picture is of the Southwark Cathedral, which is right next to the sprawling grounds of the Borough Market. I thought it quite lovely, especially in a photo coming up in a bit. This next picture is also not of food, but of an impressive apartment complex with golden lines.

I told you in the last blog that this trip showed me just how much I love gold. A lot! Now back into the market:




<div class="caption">

![](http://www.blastanova.com/photoalbum/Adventures/London%20Oct%202010/london156.JPG) These two cheeses scared me.</div>





<div class="caption">

![](http://www.blastanova.com/photoalbum/Adventures/London%20Oct%202010/london159.JPG) People reclining with their purchased goodies. I’m amazed they found a spot, actually. The market was absolutely swamped. I basically had to use my crowd technique of parting the people waters the whole time we moved through the stalls.</div>





<div class="caption">

<div class="caption">

![](http://www.blastanova.com/photoalbum/Adventures/London%20Oct%202010/london161.JPG) Scott and Zahir had these chorizo sandwiches that looked scrumptious.</div>





<div class="caption">

![](http://www.blastanova.com/photoalbum/Adventures/London%20Oct%202010/london162.JPG) I thought this photo was quite appropriate. You might not be able to see, but the cow has EAT ME painted on its side.</div>





<div class="caption">

![](http://www.blastanova.com/photoalbum/Adventures/London%20Oct%202010/london165.JPG) Want some curry? They might have enough for you.</div>





<div class="caption">

![](http://www.blastanova.com/photoalbum/Adventures/London%20Oct%202010/london166.JPG) How about some hens?</div>





<div class="caption">

![](http://www.blastanova.com/photoalbum/Adventures/London%20Oct%202010/london168.JPG) Steaming rice and red sauce?</div>


Yep, I basically wanted it all, and thus, refrained entirely. I regret that now, especially not partaking of this one vendor’s slabs of bread that were absolutely covered in dripping cheese and served up with pickles. I don’t know what they were, nor did I get a picture, but if you have any ideas, let me know. Pretty sure he had the longest line by far. Even food, one can only peruse for so long, so Ben and I wandered off toward the nearby London Bridge for more sightseeing. And we bumped right into Zahir, who had the same idea. This was our first view of the Gherkin, perhaps London’s most famous skyscraper.

Not the Gherkin, but also a pretty building, right on the edge of the bridge.

And now, here are the views from the London Bridge.

And here’s Ben’s 360 degree view from the bridge. Make sure you right-click to view the whole image.

<div class="caption">

![](http://www.blastanova.com/photoalbum/Adventures/London%20Oct%202010/london245.JPG) Here are the Tower Bridge and the HMS Belfast. You’re going to see a lot more of that bridge in the next blog on the Tower of London. I get a bit carried away with it.</div>





<div class="caption">

![](http://www.blastanova.com/photoalbum/Adventures/London%20Oct%202010/london248.JPG) This is walking back toward the Borough Market. Hello, Southwark!</div>

<div class="caption">

Finally, we had had enough of the Borough Market—those crowds are ridiculous. So where did we head? Where the sidewalks were nearly as packed as the Market, of course! We took the Underground to Camden Town, where Scott lives. This portion of the day is titled SHOPPING, though there was still some FOOD to be ogled. So basically, Camden Town is hipster/goth/punk central with lots of overpriced stores full of fashion for the stylish, and ultra-cool, young adult.

We walked along the avenue down to the Camden Lock Market, which is another area that looks deceptively small when you enter but never ends!




<div class="caption">

<div class="caption">

![](http://www.blastanova.com/photoalbum/Adventures/London%20Oct%202010/london263.JPG) Deceptively small market stalls. Oh, but it was only the beginning.</div>





<div class="caption">

![](http://www.blastanova.com/photoalbum/Adventures/London%20Oct%202010/london266.JPG) When this is one of the market’s decorations, you know you have more than a few stalls on your hands.</div>





<div class="caption">

![](http://www.blastanova.com/photoalbum/Adventures/London%20Oct%202010/london272.JPG) Heading into what I call the Golden Ceiling section of the market. Yep, more gold!</div>





<div class="caption">

![](http://www.blastanova.com/photoalbum/Adventures/London%20Oct%202010/london275.JPG) The Horse Tunnel Market entrance, which is apparently part of the larger Stable Market complex, which I think the Camden Lock Market was merely attached too. So confusing, but gosh darn pretty for shopping plazas.</div>





<div class="caption">

![](http://www.blastanova.com/photoalbum/Adventures/London%20Oct%202010/london276.JPG) Giant chandeliers? Yes, please.</div>





<div class="caption">

![](http://www.blastanova.com/photoalbum/Adventures/London%20Oct%202010/london277.JPG) More horses earning the market its name.</div>





<div class="caption">

![](http://www.blastanova.com/photoalbum/Adventures/London%20Oct%202010/london278.JPG) Cyberdog, a crazy hipster robot store. Yes, you read that right.</div>





<div class="caption">

<div class="caption">

<div class="caption">

<div class="caption">

![](http://www.blastanova.com/photoalbum/Adventures/London%20Oct%202010/london284.JPG) More gold! What’s a market in London without gold?</div>





<div class="caption">

![](http://www.blastanova.com/photoalbum/Adventures/London%20Oct%202010/london285.JPG) And the Stable Bar. We stumbled into this establishment, and it looks totally fun for a group to hang at for the evening. It’s divided into separate corrals that you can rent, all decorated differently. There was a music show going on in the middle of the space. Wave hi to Scott.</div>


From there, we headed to Scott’s flat, then off in pursuit of the evenings’ pints and food.




<div class="caption">

![](http://www.blastanova.com/photoalbum/Adventures/London%20Oct%202010/london288.JPG) Pretty row of houses with Scott, Zahir, and Sanaz walking in front.</div>





<div class="caption">

After ciders at the very popular, neighborly Southampton Arms, we headed to Scott’s favorite local pub, the Lord Stanley, and had dinner. Photos weren’t great and neither is my memory of the dishes, but all the food was delicious except for the rabbit pie. Of course, we met yet another of Scott’s friends here. The man has friends everywhere.




<div class="caption">

![](http://www.blastanova.com/photoalbum/Adventures/London%20Oct%202010/london293.JPG) Toasted bread with caper berries and some sort of fresh jam, I think.</div>





<div class="caption">

<div class="caption">

<div class="caption">

![](http://www.blastanova.com/photoalbum/Adventures/London%20Oct%202010/london297.JPG) The Rabbit Pie. The problem was that it was too thin. The accompanying greens were delicious, though.</div>





<div class="caption">

![](http://www.blastanova.com/photoalbum/Adventures/London%20Oct%202010/london298.JPG) And dessert, which was pretty good, but I don’t recall what was involved. Figs? Chestnuts? Who knows.</div>


We then parted ways for the evening, and Ben and I headed back to the hotel, passing this odd site along the way.

Coming up on London Part 3, probably next week, is the Tower of London, which was my absolutely favorite part of the trip, if only because it applies to my fantasy sensibilities so well. In the meantime, feel free to see more photos at [our photo website](http://www.blastanova.com/photoalbum/index.html?path=Adventures/London%20Oct%202010).
