One of the highlights of last year's [International Food Bloggers Conference](https://foodbloggerconference.org/) (IFBC) was a deep dive session into balsamic vinegar. Imagine yourself a strawberry going in for a dunk; it was that pleasurable to learn more about this essential member of the kitchen pantry from Federico Desimoni, director of the [Consortium for the Protection of Balsamic Vinegar of Modena PGI.](http://www.consorziobalsamico.it/?lang=en)

After learning about the process of making balsamic vinegar and the requirements for vinegar produced by these regions, the only ones recognized by the European Union with a Protective Geographic Indication (PGI), we jumped into a tasting of the two primary types coming out of Modena: young and aged.

But us food bloggers did not hesitate—we are professionals, after all! Both types of vinegar were outstanding and worth savoring by the drop. The aged vinegar is aged for 3 years or more and had the thickest, velvety mouthfeel. But as Desimoni explained, young vinegar (aged at least 60 days) has a more floral nose and may be the right choice for fresh meals such as salads or drizzled on fruit. Aged vinegar is best with cooked vegetables and meats as it deepens their flavor.

It's common for consumers, like myself, to assume that _aged_ automatically means better, but that's not the cased for the balsamic vinegars of Modena. Rather, Desimoni advised, select the vinegar with the flavor profile that will most complement your food. He also suggested swapping tomatoes with strawberries in salads when using balsamic vinegar to enjoy the unexpected balance of sweetness and acidity. I think it'd go great in this Chilled Summer Soup, made with strawberries. Try substituting the balsamic vinegar for the basil oil drizzle on the last stage of [this recipe](http://thegourmez.com/2016/06/29/pairing-pure-leafs-teahouse-collection-with-spqrs-finesse/) from SPQR Chef Matthew Accarrino.

I’m delighted I still have a sample bottle of Aged Balsamic Vinegar of Modena to discover and experiment with as I explore its flavor profile more thoroughly. How can you tell if the balsamic vinegar you're using is the real stuff from this region? It'll be labelled _Balsamic Vinegar of Modena_ or _of Reggio Emilia_, will start with _aged_ if aged, and will be designated with the letters _PGI_. No other designations are allowed; no _extra, fine, reserved, classic_, and so on. Just that PGI and this symbol:

Now go forth, get the real stuff, and enjoy this delicious designation of quality on all your new creations.
