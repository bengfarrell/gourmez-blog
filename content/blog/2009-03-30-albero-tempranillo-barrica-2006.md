There is a strong nose of sweet tobacco.  On the palate, this light- to medium-bodied wine is like drinking red licorice but without the copious sweetness.  Red chili powder is also a dominant flavor but it is restrained and the tobacco is present but more subtly than in the aroma.  This wine is acidic but not too dry.  Drinking it was a pleasure.
