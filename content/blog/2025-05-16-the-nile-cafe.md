*The Vibe:* On a recent afternoon, I visited the Niles area of Fremont for the first time. I’ve driven past the Niles sign while heading to and fro on State Route 238 before, and I briefly waved at the Niles Railroad Station while taking a ride on the historic old railroad from Sunol, but I’ve never stopped.

I learned that Niles has an army of antique shops quartered on a few short blocks, [an amazing pottery](http://thenilecafe.com/en/) store with tons of beautiful work from Mexico, and even a [nickelodeon theater and museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niles_Essanay_Silent_Film_Museum), where they play classic silent films from the days when Niles and its nearby canyon were an essential part of Essany West Studio productions.

I also learned that Niles is home to the Nile Cafe, which amusingly leaves off the “s” and uses that as an excuse to embrace Egyptian iconography.

Around ten tables fit inside the small cafe, but there’s also a patio hidden away out back. I loved all the vibrant colors throughout.

Open until mid-afternoon, the Nile Cafe offers a standard American breakfast, simple sandwiches, and incredibly reasonable prices. Some ingredient combinations, like a pear and fontina omelette, were too adventurous for me, and I don’t say that often! But there’s a good variety to choose from and great coffee options.

# My Take on The Nile Cafe

*The Food:* I ordered the sausage and spinach omelette, which had plentiful ingredients, also including onions, tomato, and cheddar cheese.


![the nile cafe omelet](https://thegourmez-wpmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/2025/5/the-nile-cafe+(5).jpg)

Great ratio of filling to egg and a good omelette overall. I opted to add “hanfries,” which, of course, are home-fried potatoes. The Nile Cafe uses an original seasoning blend; if I had to guess, I’d say dry Italian seasonings sautéed with the potatoes. The hanfries’ butter was definitely browned, which is a turnoff for some people, but I enjoyed the extra nuttiness it contributed. I’d have liked more salt, but there are shakers at the table. Toast is also available for an extra charge.

*The Drinks:* My hot Vietnamese coffee was plenty tasty and filling for a small. Condensed milk will have that effect!

Once again, I am admiring the bright colors of this spot! I’d love a table like that myself.

*Would I Go Back?* Certainly! When I take a second day trip to the Niles, maybe for next year’s Charlie Chaplin Days at the Silent Film Museum, I’ll begin it with breakfast here.
