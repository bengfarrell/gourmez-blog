**Terrenal Tempranillo and Garnacha 2009** Carinena, Spain

My word, I haven’t had a wine this uninspired in a while. It tastes metallic, with thin strawberry and fig flavors. There’s a little bit of greenery involved that reminds me of eucalyptus. It’s okay, but there are so many better wines in the world.

The color is a ruby red with black highlights. The nose is maraschino cherries, blueberry jam, cocoa powder and a little tea. The Terrenal starts out with bright sweet cherry that quickly changes to blackberry, cassis and licorice. There are nice flavors, but the wine comes off as a bit on the watery side. The mid-palate brings chocolate ganache and some spice, the finish is cassis and chocolate, but it gives up a little too soon.
