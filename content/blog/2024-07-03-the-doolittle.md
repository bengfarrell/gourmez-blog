# The Scoop on The Doolittle

*Address:* 20394 Lake Chabot Rd\
Castro Valley, CA\
*Website:* <https://www.thedoolittlebar.com/>\
*Phone*: 510-581-2405

I didn’t realize how new this bar was when I lived in Hayward the first time! It opened in 2013, so has just reached a decade of service. 

The Doolittle gets crowded on the weekend, for sure! And probably on trivia night, though I’ve never been to that. Parking is a bit of a pain, but if the tiny lot is full, you should find some on the street within a few blocks.

*The Vibe:* I’d classify this as a neighborhood bar, with a friendly vibe and a canoe shell serving as shelf space for the bar and dominating the view. The back wall is lined with large, blonde wooden booths, and the middle consists of long, narrow high-tops, also blonde wood. An eclectic mix of knick-knacks and plaques decorates the walls.

# My Take on The Doolittle

*The Drinks:* The Doolittle offers 10+ taps, so it’s great for beer lovers. And they have a good cocktail list as well, also with 10+ options and fun names like the _Ra’z Al Mhul_. I’d like to see those cocktails switched up once in a while, but I get bored with familiar flavors far more easily than the average consumer.

I’ve enjoyed both the _Oaxaca Old Fashioned_ and the _Cool As a Cucumber_ on past visits. On this one, I ordered the _strawberry-lavender gimlet_, and boy did I choose well! The bartender that night said it was the only craft cocktail on the Doolittle’s menu that she'd learned so far, and she learned it well—so good!

Its ingredients are Awayuki Japanese Craft Strawberry Gin, lime juice, and lavender, and they were so smoothly blended: no soapiness to the lavender or cloying sweetness from the strawberry. Clearly, the latter is because it’s an infused gin rather than one with fresh juice, and frankly, I need to find it to buy for my own alcohol cabinet.

*Would I Go Back?* Totally, but it’s not in my local neighborhood, so visits aren’t as frequent as I’d like. Regardless, it’s a trusty spot to end the night after dining out, knowing I’ll have a great nightcap or two.
