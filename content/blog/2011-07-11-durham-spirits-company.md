**Durham Spirits Company** 311 E. Trinity Avenue [Website](http://www.durhamspiritscompany.com/) Single Classes run $49 to $59

Durham Spirits Company is a new venture by Katie Coleman, a chef and culinary instructor at The Art Institute of Raleigh-Durham with years of international training. She opened Durham Spirits Company to offer cooking and mixology classes, and I had the pleasure of attending the opening of the business. Right away I was struck by the amazing home that Katie’s renting to provide space for the classes. It’s absolutely gorgeous, and it’s a historic house in Old North Durham smack dab at the end of Elizabeth Street. Let’s take a little tour: Front sitting room [![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2011/07/bullcityspirits07.jpg "bullcityspirits07")](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2011/07/bullcityspirits07.jpg) The cute bar made of gorgeous wooden antiques where mixology classes are held. Katie, who was lovely and rightfully proud of her venture, said she was mainly focused on spirits that we can buy at the ABC stores, because what’s the fun of learning to shake up a cocktail only to have the liquor unavailable for us to purchase and experiment with? I’m signed up to take a classic gin cocktail course in August, which is a hole in my repertoire. There were a few small bar tables in the room as well.

[![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2011/07/bullcityspirits04.jpg "bullcityspirits04")](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2011/07/bullcityspirits04.jpg) [![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2011/07/bullcityspirits05.jpg "bullcityspirits05")](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2011/07/bullcityspirits05.jpg) [![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2011/07/bullcityspirits06.jpg "bullcityspirits06")](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2011/07/bullcityspirits06.jpg) All the food messily thrown onto my plate—it was delicious. The grapefuit mojo sauce on the pork was especially tasty. [![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2011/07/bullcityspirits09.jpg "bullcityspirits09")](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2011/07/bullcityspirits09.jpg) The best part of the house, by far, is the huge porch in the back, affording a beautiful view of kudzu wilderness and lots of space for lounging when the weather allows, which it luckily did this afternoon. [![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2011/07/bullcityspirits01.jpg "bullcityspirits01")](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2011/07/bullcityspirits01.jpg) [![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2011/07/bullcityspirits02.jpg "bullcityspirits02")](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2011/07/bullcityspirits02.jpg) All in all, I had a great afternoon just talking with Katie and her crew of volunteers, most of whom were recruited by their love of Katie's cooking. Courses coming up in July include tapas, making lunch from Farmer’s Market bounty (meeting at the Market to talk produce first), a rum tasting, Greek food, cooking with tomatoes, and summer brunch.
