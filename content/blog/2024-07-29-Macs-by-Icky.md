*The Vibe:* I've seen a couple other coffee shops in this space now, and Macs by Icky has made it their own!

Formerly a popular food truck, Macs by Icky purveys "Filipino-inspired desserts, bevs & more," which includes sweet coffee inventions, halo-halo, smashed lemonades, and savory items like pandasal sandwiches. They gained popularity with their handmade, choco taco-inspired treats, but the croffles seem to be a great contender for signature item as well.

The feel of Macs by Icky on a busy day is that of an ice cream parlor: more of a short-term hangout spot than one to linger in for hours. But on a slow day, I don't think taking up a table for a while would be discouraged. The staff is quite friendly and welcoming.

# My Take on Macs by Icky

*The Food:* I've had two desserts so far, and I enjoy their sense of playfulness and ability to satisfy a sweet tooth. Let's start with their famed choco tacos. They usually have 4–5 flavors on hand, and the ube pistachio is likely the most popular. Because I was already having a pistachio beverage on this last trip, I went for strawberry crunch instead. They come frozen enough that I had no fear of making a mess for a good five minutes' worth of picture taking.

The strawberry crunch choco taco mimics the flavor of ye olde Good Humor strawberry shortcake bar very well. The crunch layer that seals in the bright strawberry ice cream is very tasty. The waffle cone held up until the last two bites as well—I consider that a feat of engineering! This is a hearty and deliciously sweet treat.

Their croffles are even heartier.

I went full ube for this one. Ube has a mild flavor that I often find plain . . . but it's hard to resist that bright purple. The croffle is topped with ube-flavored halaya (a sort of jam) and condensed milk, and the little pearls are white chocolate.

To my surprise, the ube had tons of flavor! +1 to Macs by Icky for getting me to believe in the power of ube beyond its bold color. The croffle didn't seem much different from a waffle to me, maybe a little denser, but who's going to complain about a waffle whipped-cream sundae? Not me!

I'm less enthused by Macs by Icky's coffee offerings. To be fair, primo coffee is not really their focus here. The average customer coming in probably wants a dessert coffee or milk beverage, not the pure black elixir of caffeine that I prefer.

I did try a pistachio latte with oat milk.

I love pistachio in desserts SO MUCH. But this is the second time I've had it in a coffee drink, and I'm just not that into the combo. My husband liked his, however! The pistachio flavor in the whipped cream is light, but mix up the coffee and syrup near the bottom and it concentrates a lot.

I've also had an iced coffee at Macs by Icky, which was a-okay. I need to try a smashed lemonade next time.

Digging back a bit in my files, I've also had Macs by Icky's ube flinkle cookie from before they opened their storefront! It's a combo of a crinkle cookie and flan.

I ate that sucker up and enjoyed the mix of crispy and chewy and that velvety hit of flan in the middle. Baked goods are regularly offered in the brick-and-mortar store.

*Would I Go Back?* Do I have a massive sweet tooth? Yes, yes, I do. Macs by Icky satiates it with fun takes on classic desserts, both American and Filipino. I wish they stayed open a little later than 8pm on the weekends. But I also wish I already had their halo-halo served up to try next. Plus, they are only a block away from the Birdhaus beer garden, one of my favorite places for hanging out and Hawaiian food in the area.

*Visited April 2023 (the cookie) and June & July 2024.*
