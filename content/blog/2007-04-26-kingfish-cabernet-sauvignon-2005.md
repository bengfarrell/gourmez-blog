**Kingfish Cabernet Sauvignon** Other words on the label: California 2005

This wine was a delight to drink. It is one of those rare light-bodied cabernets that drinking doesn't feel like swimming upstream against the current.

Plum featured most prominently on the palate, with a gentle hint of chocolate and brown sugar. This mixture was mildy seasoned with black pepper.

It was smooth, flavorful, and elegant.
