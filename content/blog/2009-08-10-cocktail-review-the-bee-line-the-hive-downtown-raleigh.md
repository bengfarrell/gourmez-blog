**The Bee Line** The Hive [Website](http://www.busybeeraleigh.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=80&Itemid=67) Downtown Raleigh

The Bee Line is a fruity drink made with Cruzan Light, muddled strawberries, rhubarb bitters, brown sugar syrup, and honey.    Served up in a hurricane glass, it was quite tasty at first but gets watery by the halfway mark.  The level of sweetness was kept under control.  With a stronger rum, this would have been perfect.
