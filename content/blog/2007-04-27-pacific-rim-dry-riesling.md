**Pacific Rim Dry Riesling** Other stuff on the label: Bonny Doon Vineyard

I don't often comment on labels but this one deserves special attention. The artwork is quite perplexing and I can't hazard a guess as to its meaning. Just let it be said that the Santa Cruz area, where Bonny Doon Winery is housed, is a very liberal community. Knowing that really makes my head hurt when I try to comprehend the label. There is a little cleavage exposed on the chest of a slanted eyed woman. She is strangely contorted into some sort of laying down position, while reading a book. Did I mention this was in a clamshell? Floating in the wine, meaning that they are imprinted on the back of the bottle, are chili peppers, cilantro, star anise, ginger, and a head of garlic. Draw your own conclusions and email them to me. I'd really like to know.

The taste is strongly lemon, mellowed slightly with the sweetness of apples. I sense clove, but that may just be the apples' fault as they always make me think of Christmas seasonings. It comes across dryly on the roof of the mouth but not elsewhere. There's also a tinge of cedar when rolled over the tongue.

Held to the light, the riesling is flax wheat blond and very clear. My nose couldn't pick up any specific smells, so I had Mr. Gourmez give it a try. He declares the nose to be metallic and sugary.

An unobtrusive wine that would be perfect for those who love their citrus.
