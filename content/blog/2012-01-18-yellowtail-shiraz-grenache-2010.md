**Yellowtail Shiraz Grenache 2010** Southeastern Australia

[![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2012/01/yellowtailshirazgrenache.jpg "yellowtailshirazgrenache")](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2012/01/yellowtailshirazgrenache.jpg) Blueberry flavors come first with this wine, but they melt away into something that reminds me of the fig butter I just picked up from Trader Joe’s. But this wine is bitterer than the fig butter and pretty dry. There’s a heat to it, and I’d call it medium bodied.

None of that combines especially well. It’s not horrible, but it’s not far off, either.

[Chez Moi](http://linhtheprocrastinator.blogspot.com/2011/11/wine-review-yellow-tail-shiraz-grenache.html)

Color: dark purple Aroma: closed but fresh fruits are present, hint of vanilla, pepper Taste: chewy, spicy, med tannins, medium finish, slight acidic

. . . It’s mostly dry, but has an almost indiscernible sweetness at the very end . . .J’s Review: I like it the same as the Shiraz, and better than the Cabernet. Tastes a little bit bitter, but a good kind of bitter. Would buy again.

 

[The Value Vine](http://www.thevaluevine.com/2011/04/02/2009-yellow-tail-shiraz-cabernet/) on the 2009 vintage

As fruity as the Yellow Tail Merlot [reviewed above](http://www.thevaluevine.com/?p=965), this Shiraz-Cabernet blend is a little bolder, with more sweet spice, riper fruit, and even some minerality. This one also lacks the hot, alcohol-driven nose of the Merlot.
