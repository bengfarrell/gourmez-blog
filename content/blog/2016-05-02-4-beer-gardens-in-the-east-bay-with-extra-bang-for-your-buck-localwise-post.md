You may have noticed my recent post on [Telegraph Beer Garden](http://thegourmez.com/2016/04/26/telegraph-beer-garden/)? I went there to gather info for my new Localwise article: [4 Beer Gardens in the East Bay with Extra Bang for Your Buck](https://www.localwisejobs.com/blog/4-beer-gardens-giving-extra-bang-for-your-buck/)! You can head over and read that article now, but I also have full reviews here on the other beer gardens I chose to profile....except for Brotzeit Lokal, whose review is going up in a couple of days! [Find it here when it is.](http://thegourmez.com/2016/05/05/brotzeit-lokal-review-oakland)

The other two beer gardens that have most impressed me--thus far--in the East Bay are [Westbrae Biergarten](http://thegourmez.com/2015/09/01/westbrae-biergarten/) on the Albany/Berkeley line and Drake's Dealership, which I got a [sneak peek of](http://thegourmez.com/2015/09/01/westbrae-biergarten/) back when the Hive opened last fall. That reminds me, I need to go back and give them my full write-up treatment! With food as good as this duck confit--with grits, hazelnuts, and cherries--I welcome the excuse. The pizzas are delish as well.

Hope you enjoy the new Localwise post! And I am always open for beer garden suggestions -- I may not be the biggest beer drinker, but I love trying new brews regardless.
