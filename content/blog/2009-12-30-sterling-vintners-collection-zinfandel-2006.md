**Wine:** Sterling Vintner's Collection Zinfandel 2006 **Region:** Central Coast, CA

My apologies for the lack of a picture. Oops. Guess I was too busy drinking!

This is a dry wine, with notes of tobacco, soft orange, and chocolate.  I can't complain about it but I can't endorse it, either. I had hoped for more.
