**Little Red Corvette** Jujube, Chapel Hill [http://www.jujuberestaurant.com](http://www.jujuberestaurant.com/) $9

The Little Red Corvette is made with agave syrup, tequila, and hibiscus nectar.  It was served in a double old-fashioned glass.  The drink was a beautiful carmine pink at bottom, with the shade getting lighter the higher up it went.

Hibiscus is a great choice for a tequila cocktail.  It has a strong punch that cuts through the equally strong agave syrup and tequila very well.  This is a drink with flavors that demand your attention.

Final Verdict?  A tad too sweet for it to be a masterpiece but it's close.
