**The Whippet** Jujube [http://www.jujuberestaurant.com](http://www.jujuberestaurant.com/)

Jujube's bartenders definitely know how to make a good cocktail.  The whippet is a gem of a drink with Finlandia grapefruit-flavored vodka, Cava, and lychee juice.    It looked like a Lemon Drop minus the sugary rim, an elegant, white gold drink with an ice shard layer that I love.  The taste was wonderfully layered as well; all elements were present and accounted for and happy to share the limelight.
