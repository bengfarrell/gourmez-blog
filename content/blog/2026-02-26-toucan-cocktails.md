## Details on Toucan Cocktails

When [Toucan Cocktails](http://toucancocktails.com/) reached out to ask if I’d be interested in trying their unique canned cocktail products, I said yes. Although they’ve been flooding the market the last few years, I’ve only had a dozen canned cocktails at most. Of those, I’ve maybe enjoyed half. As to how Toucan Cocktails would affect that ratio, I had no idea, but I was rooting for them! Why? Because their unique design won me over. It features a small can nestled on top of a larger one. After opening both of them, and pouring the top can full of spirits into the larger one, the cans snap together to create a cocktail shaker.

This design keeps the hard liquor from combining with the cocktail mixers until you’re ready for your drink, whether on vacation, at the beach, or enjoying a nightcap under the stars.

Most canned cocktails can be shaken, yes, but the Toucan Cocktail design adds an extra layer of fun and vivaciousness to the experience by keeping those ingredients separate. Here’s how you combine them:

That method brings cocktails on-the-go closer to the experience of having one served to you at a bar or restaurant. There’s a satisfying layer of foam after pouring, no doubt from the “beverage cloud emulsion” ingredient listed on some of the cans. The drinks are plenty strong, made with base spirits of 40–80% alcohol by volume (ABV). Each double can is intended to pour two cocktails, and at those strengths, ice melting should be part of the calculation!

Needing to bring ice along wherever you plan to take your Toucan Cocktails is the only con of this design that I could see, but you’d have the same problem with any to-go cocktail option. Some sacrifices must be made for convenience.

So does Toucan Cocktails sacrifice too much in their hunt for canned cocktail greatness? Let's find out!

## Thoughts on Tasting Toucan Cocktails

I received the Toucan Cocktails variety mix, which is six double cans, each of a different type, retailing on their website for \$60. That’s the standard price for all their options, which means they cost about \$5 a drink. Order two or more cartons, and shipping is free. Sure beats happy hour prices in the Bay Area!

I’ll go in the order that I sampled the drinks. Do note that any garnishes you see are additions I added from my kitchen—Toucan Cocktails is doing a lot to reproduce the bar cocktail experience, but garnishes are not yet part of that package.

![toucan cocktails cosmo](https://thegourmez-wpmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/2026/3/toucan-cocktails+(8).jpg)

**Cosmopolitan**: Cosmopolitans are my go-to cocktail when drink lists are unavailable, so I have *opinions* on how well they are done. The balance of cranberry, lime, orange, and vodka in the Toucan Cocktail version was just right, especially the lime—many bartenders fail to add enough lime to balance out the sweetness of the juice and orange liqueur, in my  opinion.

The vodka was quite strong in the mix, but giving the cocktail a few minutes to chill and take on some ice melt before shaking helped with that. There was a subtle plastic taste on the finish that I did not love but could easily overlook when taking another sip.

![toucan cocktails lemon drop](https://thegourmez-wpmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/2026/3/toucan-cocktails+(12).jpg)

**Lemon Drop**: This one’s a classic of 90s cocktail culture, along with the cosmopolitan. I expect a lemon drop martini to be quite sweet, and the Toucan Cocktail lemon drop martini was for sure, but a strong and bitter lemon presence counteracted the sweetness well. I preferred that increased bitterness over the standard saccharine bar-served lemon drop. The martini reminded me of drinking in my twenties in all the right ways.

![toucan cocktails paloma](https://thegourmez-wpmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/2026/3/toucan-cocktails+(14).jpg)

**Paloma**: The grapefruit flavor in this cocktail tasted artificial to me. It was also more delicate than I expected, as I associate palomas with freshly squeezed, tart grapefruit and strong tequila. The Toucan Cocktail paloma is a nice, easy drink, but I prefer the punch of fresh juice. It should be noted that palomas were originally made with grapefruit soda, so this version may be intended to be closer to that than what I’ve typically encountered. Tasty, but not a substitute for one that’s just been made from scratch.

![toucan cocktails margarita](https://thegourmez-wpmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/2026/3/toucan-cocktails+(16).jpg)

**Margarita**: This Toucan Cocktail came out extra foamy! The tequila and sour mix played well together, and it scratched that margarita itch. A favorite of the bunch, for sure. I finished it off first when working through the remainders from my tasting over the next couple weeks.

![toucan cocktails old fashioned](https://thegourmez-wpmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/2026/3/toucan-cocktails+(19).jpg)

**Old-Fashioned**: This is a drinkable substitute for an old-fashioned, but fresh is best for this classic cocktail. The ingredients in the Toucan Cocktail cans approximate what a good bartender is doing to create one: muddling sugar and bitters with whisky and water, adding ice, and garnishing it all with maraschino cherries and an orange twist or slice. Often, the fruits will be muddled in the first step, too, contributing juice to the glass. The “cherry flavor” and “orange extract” in Toucan Cocktail’s ingredient list just doesn’t capture that bartender finesse. And the caramel extract for adding color to the whiskey is disappointing—why not use an aged whisky instead? The Toucan Cocktail Old-Fashioned captures the idea, but not the spirit, of the drink.

![toucan cocktails espresso martini](https://thegourmez-wpmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/2026/3/toucan-cocktails+(23).jpg)

**Espresso**: I found the Toucan Cocktail espresso martini highly satisfying. Its coffee flavor is robust, with thanks to cold brew, brewed coffee, and coffee extract all making an appearance. The vodka complements them with a strong kick. Vanilla is welcome, though I’d personally kick up the orange flavor, as I love coffee and orange. But as orange is not a typical espresso martini ingredient, I simply applaud its inclusion.

I do enjoy a little cream in the espresso martinis I make for myself, often adding a dollop of Kahlua or Bailey’s Irish Cream. This cocktail has nondairy condensed milk, but I’d argue for an extra pour. Let me be clear, however: this espresso martini is delicious as is.

*What were my winning flavors?* The margarita, espresso, and lemon drop cocktails are ones I’d be happy to drink again. 

*Good enough?* The cosmopolitan—that plastic aftertaste *was* off putting, but not enough that I’d put down the glass. 

*Which ones would I pass on?* The paloma and the old-fashioned were not up to snuff, mainly because ingredient freshness is a central part of the originals’ appeal for me.

![toucan cocktails old fashioned cans](https://thegourmez-wpmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/2026/3/toucan-cocktails+(18).jpg)

*Would I Purchase Them Myself?* The Toucan Cocktail concept is exciting and brings extra thoughtful design to the to-go cocktail market, by making shaking and pouring them more of an event. Whatever that “beverage cloud emulsion” is, it has my full support. I wouldn’t hesitate to reach for most of the Toucan Cocktail line again, and at that \$60 price per pack, I will be considering a margarita, cosmopolitan, or espresso option for my and my husband’s upcoming 20th anniversary trip. That each two-bottle shaker set makes enough for two drinks? How felicitous.
