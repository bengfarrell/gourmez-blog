# Thoughts on Tasting the Prats & Symington Prazo de Roriz 2018 Douro Red Wine

*Most memorable flavors?* This one smells of juicy red grapes. Licorice, tobacco, and molasses notes in the nose as well; those probably developed as it aged. I can smell strawberries nearly past their prime, the type that will crumble between your fingertips.

It tastes quite nice, with the aged flavors stronger than the fruit. I get fruit leather, a crank of cracked anise, whiff of bourbon vanilla, and a mild pepper finish. The fruit is warm, stewed plums with rhubarb. Soft tannins at the finish.

*What would I pair it with?* Duck, perhaps an Italian duck sauce like the sugo I had recently at [Belotti](https://thegourmez.com/blog/2025-08-25-belotti/). Perhaps venison. It calls for gamey meat that it can complement well.

*What* did *I pair it with?* Pets for my cat Bemo.

*Would I drink it again?* Yes. I’d be intrigued to find out how different it tasted when years younger, so I may look for a newer bottling to compare. It’s a wine to linger over.

*At this \$17 price?* This bottle offered surprising depth at that price point, so I’d certainly consider buying a case and letting a few age this long again.

*Reviewed August 2025.*
