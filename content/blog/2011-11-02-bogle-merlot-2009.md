Bogle Merlot 2009 Graton, CA

This wine strikes me as smooth right away. It’s full of bright fruit, but not tart fruit like so many bottle I drank over the past two months. The main notes are strawberry and a juicy, juicy plum with subtle spice and vanilla.

 

I enjoy how unobtrusive and delicious this merlot is. If you’re in the mood for an easygoing, sunny wine, this is a great choice.

> Nose: Blackberry, smoked plums, earth, barrel room, confectionery. Taste: Medium-full mouthfeel. Medium-high acid. Soft, full, and smoked plums. Red berries and cranberries. Extended finish for the price point.

[Table Wine](http://www.tablewine.com/blog/?p=859)

> Pale ruby in color, this Merlot has a subdued earthy nose with mushroom notes. Light to medium bodied, it delivers dry red-berry flavors with beefy undertones. Well structured, with supple tannins, it has a lingering tart-berry finish.

[First Pour Wine](http://www.firstpourwine.com/2011/04/28/first-pour-wine-episode-3/)

> **Smell:** Raspberry, cedar, and black pepper are the front runners, but the wine pulls in nuances of fresh chopped ginger, licorice, chocolate, jalapeño, and soy sauce. S**ip:** Aggressive tannins and a full mouth feel are the forerunners for a slightly hot blackberry and cedar flavor.  Touches of leather and diesel accompany.

> **Savor:** Alcohol and tannins maintain a strong presence but fade into blackberry and raspberry.

> This merlot is quite interesting, but doesn’t have the softness that is sometimes associated with merlot.  It could potentially use another year, but it is a rather fun wine because of its complexity and unique smells.
