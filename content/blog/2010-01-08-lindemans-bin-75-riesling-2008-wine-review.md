**Wine:** Lindemans' Bin 75 Riesling 2008 **Region:** Australia

On first sip, I like it. A lot. There's a mild sweetness that contrasts with its acidity. Fresh honeydew and tangerine notes linger. There's some flower in the party, too -- perhaps lavender, but I'm no expert at guessing floral notes.

. . . The wine came. It smelled like rain. It tasted like spring rain, too, with a hint of grapefruit. Very soft, very fresh, absolutely no body whatsoever. It was missing the sparkle that Rieslings usually have. It wasn't a bad wine, but we were disappointed, and glad that we didn't order a bottle.

If you are looking for a not overly sweet white, then this is your white. Aromas of lime and lemon zest are complimented with subtle hints of peach notes. The flavors are straightforward; layers of pears, stone fruit and sweet cantaloupe are framed with the finish of the citrus zest. The finish is subtle not overpowering the taste buds. A great light sweeter style white that won't break the bank.

The sweetness of the wine is great with spicy foods. We always enjoy this wine with sushi or Thai foods. The fruit sweet flavors tend to calm the spice in each bite and cleanse the palette making each bite a new taste experience.
