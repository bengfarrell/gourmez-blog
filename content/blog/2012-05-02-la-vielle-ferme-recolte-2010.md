This red table wine smells like a black raspberry gumdrop. It tastes like a liquid black raspberry gumdrop with hints of licorice and eucalyptus. The aftertase is all spice, mostly cinnamon. Some strawberry and vanilla also comes through.

It’s a thin-bodied wine with exquisite layers, making it infinitely and easily drinkable.

[The Wine Newbies](http://thewinenewbies.com/2011/05/01/2009-la-vieille-ferme-recolte/) on the 2009 vintage

> This French wine had a very pleasant bouquet and was easy on the pallet. With aromas of blackberry, oak, and spice the taste closely followed with added flavors of cherry . . . and more spice. The color was ruby red and had a light to medium texture. I was hoping for a longer finish, but the lingering spicy flavors made up for it. This wine had a mysterious quality that took a few sips to determine the aroma and taste, but overall, was pleasant to drink.
