I have info on a couple of upcoming events for you guys. First, and foremost because it involves me, is the fourth meeting of the Social Media Supper Club, which is an excuse for me and two other Twitter users and food lovers, Mandy @demandy and Brian @BCwritr, to try a new restaurant together and hope that you will come along, too! This time we are headed to [Lucky 32](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=1&sqi=2&ved=0CBMQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lucky32.com%2F&rct=j&q=lucky%2032&ei=an9YTfePGJS-tgf4psitDQ&usg=AFQjCNEuFm3nbWzCRxuJ2-jwM5P1jbUjiw&sig2=28XK1i9norGDx2R42GQFhA&cad=rja) in Cary, which you may remember from my post on the third [Tri Foodie Tweetup](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CBMQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.thegourmez.com%2F%3Fp%3D1654&rct=j&q=tri%20foodie%20tweetup%20lucky%2032&ei=7H5YTfL1N8i3twfvp8HyDA&usg=AFQjCNE_S45_abrCUokxaIyvgO0CyDq0cA&sig2=IyTjiub8eTA1J6CI_xcfVQ&cad=rja) a few months back. I thought the appetizers were delicious and inventive then, so I’m very excited to try their regular menu with friends new and old. We are meeting at 7:00 pm on 2/22. RSVP [here](http://www.amiando.com/smsc) but do it soon—only 10 spots left!

Next, the 5th annual Empty Bowls fundraiser will be held on 3/3 from 5:30 to 8 pm at the Armory to benefit [Urban Ministries of Durham’s food pantry](http://www.umdurham.org/what-we-do/food-pantry.html) and help Durhamites in need. At the event, a panel of local celebrities judge each restaurant’s soup offering and the event-goers get to vote for the popular choice award with their wallets. I can’t make it this year, but I did have fun [sampling the restaurants’ soup](../../../../../?p=888) contenders last year. Participants this go-round are blu seafood, Toast, Papa Mojo's Roadhouse, Revolution, Watts Grocery, Whole Foods, Thrills From the Grill Catering, and Guglhupf. Revolution’s chicken masa soup, which won and has been glimpsed on their menu often, was fantastic last year. Tickets are $30 for soup sampling and an artisan bowl to take home (I love mine!) or $15 for just the soup. Get your tickets [](http://www.umdurham.org/what-we-do/food-pantry.html)[here](https://www.etix.com/ticket/online/venueSearch.jsp?venue_id=5971) soon or you can call (919) 682-0538 or come to 410 Liberty Street to purchase them. A word to the wise: go early because it gets super crowded and you don’t want the soup to run out before you get to try them all!

Last, I wanted to mention that Dave Chapman, the owner of the Homestead branch and head roaster for all the [Bean Traders](http://beantraders.blogspot.com/) and a few other coffee shops (including one in Pittsboro that I’ll have a post up on later this week) , has started [a blog on coffee roasting](http://masterbrews.blogspot.com/). I’m learning a lot already! If you’re a coffee enthusiast, you should definitely check it out.
