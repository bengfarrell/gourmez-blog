Readers, I don't often post information from press releases, but this sounds like an excellent contest, and could there be better timing than Halloween for it? [Historic Hotels of America](http://www.historichotels.org/?src=1806114632&_ga=1.5153137.336491784.1444437436) is sponsoring an impressive getaway contest that will stick you in a fantastic hotel in a great, central New Orleans location and hook you up with pretty much everything you need to take advantage of your trip. Here are the details:

> Enter to win our Historic Haunts of New Orleans Sweepstakes!
>
> Beginning September 24, 2015 through October 31, 2015, participants can enter to win a special three-night getaway in New Orleans with a variety of exciting and spooky prizes and offers.
>
> One lucky grand prize winner will receive:
>
> \- One three-night stay for two at the Hilton New Orleans/St. Charles Avenue - Two-day New Orleans Power Pass for two adults - One $500 American Express® gift card - French Quarter Ghost Tour for two adults - $300 in Dining Credits from the Rib Room and Commander’s Palace
>
> To enter the Historic Haunts of New Orleans Sweepstakes, participants can enter the official registration form located [online](http://americandreams.historichotels.org/haunted-sweepstakes). Participants can simply click on “submit to enter to win.” Registrants for the Historic Haunts of New Orleans Sweepstakes must provide all information requested to receive an entry.

I already entered, and it was as painless as advertised. The only restrictions I could see are that the winner must be 25 years of age or older, must be a legal U.S. resident (excluding Puerto Rico),  and must use the prize by the end of March 2016. You can get bonus entries by referring friends through social media as well. You can enter through Halloween, of course.

I'd wish you good luck, but well, I want to win. A return, paid-except-for-airfare, visit to New Orleans would be amazing.

Laissez les bon temps roulez!
