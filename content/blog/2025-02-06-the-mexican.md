# The 411 on The Mexican

*Address:* 19950 Hesperian Blvd\
Hayward, CA\
*Website:* <https://www.themexicanhayward.com/>\
*Phone:* 510-785-8200

*The Vibe:* The Mexican is one of several restaurants owned by Alejandro Gamarra in the Hayward area. His other businesses include Metro Taquero's fast-casual joints and the upscale Casa del Toro in downtown Hayward.

In terms of atmosphere, the Mexican sits squarely between Gamarra's other restaurants. It's closest to a family cantina and offers platters of Mexican favorites, usually with rice and beans. But it kicks that familiar menu up a notch for presentation, preparation, and pricing. 

They offer an excellent cocktail list.

Taco Tuesdays is the best value for dining at the Mexican, with much more affordable options available on the specials menu that day, such as chicken tinga tostadas and \$4 street tacos.

The most controversial move The Mexican has pulled is charging for chips and salsa. Of course, we all complained about it last year, as they'd always been offered for free before. The chips and salsa are now available for a \$4 charge that also includes bean dip. We usually forgo them since the change, which I have to admit, is probably better for our waistlines.

# My Take on The Mexican

*The Food:* Your best bet at The Mexican is to head for the Specialties or Clasicos section of the menu. There, you will find rich mole sauces and delights like crab and shrimp rellanos in roasted poblano cream, the tasty chicken with garlic lemon sauce, and chile verde with large chunks of meat and tasty grilled onions and jalapeno.

When grilled vegetables are listed as a side instead of beans, they are a simple sauté of squash and broccoli with butter, which I like for a change.

I do find some of the Mexican "favorites" light on flavor and heavy on the salt. The flautas, quesadillas, and chimichangas come to mind. I pass them up now after having tried them a few times, usually with carnitas or shredded chicken.

But The Mexican shines when complex sauces come into play or the umami of their grilled foods is highlighted, like in the fajitas and molcajetes bowls. Or when they're going for a more deconstructed version of the classics, like the nachos and taco salad. Those are served with various toppings each in their own little pile on the platter. I quite like that I can scoop up a little jalapeno, cheese, guacamole, or tomato with each bite.

Dessert is a great choice! No fried ice cream here. Instead, try their excellent bread pudding with a delicious crème anglaise.

The buñelos aren't quite as exciting for me, but they do look snazzy in presentation! I wish I had a picture to share of them with you. But I do have plenty from brunch! The Mexican's brunch menu is limited, but I've found the carne asada omelette and the French toast to be good choices.

The French toast comes with a layer of cajeta and a side of eggs and bacon—that's not a bad value for \$20 around here!

The carne aside chilaquiles are done in that deconstructed style like the nachos and taco salad.

The approach is not as successful for this dish, requiring that you cut each bite, rather than scoop up freely with fingers or a fork. The chips need more sauce to meet my chilaquiles standards, too. But if you want a nice hunk of steak, maybe it'd work for you!

*The Drinks:* My favorite cocktails at The Mexican are not the many margarita varieties, though it is fun to get one topped off with a tiny bottle of Korbel or Gran Gala once in a while. I typically opt for the mezcal sangria. It's served up in a giant wine glass, with lots of smoky flavor cutting through the sweetness of the fruit wine punch.

Or I go for the Paloma Rosa.

That's a grapefruit, mezcal, Aperol, elderflower, and agave combination. Yes, yes, I do love mezcal! I also love that The Mexican has flights of mezcal and tequila, too, if you want to try a few.

Brunch offers their regular cocktail menu, micheladas, bloody Marys, and bottomless mimosas.

*Would I Go Back?* The Mexican is a neighborhood joint for us, so we go at least once a month. I do try to make use of their Taco Tuesday specials for the value. Sometimes, the fajitas appeal more with their thoroughly grilled, thinly sliced onion and bell pepper that melt in your mouth. Other times, I'd rather go for one of those overflowing street tacos on Taco Tuesday or even just a tasty bowl of tortilla soup.

Regardless, there are plenty of options at the Mexican! It may take a few trips to find your favorites, but many of them are worth the price.
