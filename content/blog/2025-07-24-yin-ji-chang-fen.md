*The Vibe:* This place is hopping, even on weekdays! I‚Äôm so glad to see a business doing well in this spot by the San Lorenzo post office. It‚Äôs one of five locations in the Bay Area, and Yin Ji Chang Fen has expanded into New York as well. There are similar chains in Philadelphia and Texas, but I'm not sure it's the same company.

The interior design is light and welcoming.

Rows of tables fill the space, and patrons fill the tables, sharing most dishes family style. Wait service will direct you to a table promptly. Though QR codes are available for ordering and paying, the wait staff is quick to take orders and payment directly from the customers.

Chang fen, a Cantonese street food, is the star of the cuisine. Long, wide rice noodle rolls hold a variety of fillings and come covered in a sweet soy sauce. Also on the menu is congee (rice porridge); dim sum staples like shum mai, dumplings, and chicken feet; and fried noodle and rice dishes.

## My Take on Yin Ji Chang Fen

*The Food:* Of course, I had to try chang fen! I opted for the BBQ pork and dried shrimp combo for the filling, and I added scallions for a small upcharge. Most of the dishes offer several modification options.

The chang fen was quite a nice treat! I was slightly worried that the dried shrimp flavor would be overwhelming, but it dissolved well into the soy-based sauce. The barbecue flavor was sweet but slightly smoky. I appreciated the vegetal zing the scallions brought to the dish. Do add some of the mild, yet lively, vinegar sauce on the table. The chile  sauce also deserves a shout-out.

I assume it‚Äôs made in-house or at a production facility for the chain. It‚Äôs savory for a hot sauce, providing flavor beyond the heat that‚Äôll enhance your dishes.

On my first trip, I also tried walnut steam buns from the dim sum menu. I didn‚Äôt know whether they were sweet or savory when I ordered them.

Sweet! But the wheat steam bun is not sweet itself, just the filling of walnuts, cream sauce, and brown sugar. One made for a satisfying palate cleanser; the second I didn‚Äôt inhale until a whole hour later, I swear. üòâ

I couldn‚Äôt help but notice that congee seemed the most popular dish ordered at Yin Ji Chang Fen, despite *chang fen* being part of their name. So on a second visit, I tried the congee instead. I chose the Liwan style for the most variety of ingredients. It includes pork, white fish, shrimp, egg omelette strips, and peanuts. I also added a golden preserved egg because I was curious to try one.

Loved the soothing, salty flavor of the broth and that the thickness was on the thinner side for porridge. I was disappointed that the pork served was fatty and steamed or broiled, rather than the pictured barbecue-style cut, but I enjoyed the flavors so much that it wasn‚Äôt a dealbreaker. Next time, I may opt for a simpler beef or chicken congee, especially if I‚Äôm craving comfort in a bowl.

You can‚Äôt see it in the picture, but the golden preserved egg was bold and rich, with a jammy texture. I‚Äôm glad I tried it. But I‚Äôm not sure extra egg is needed with the omelette strips the dish already comes with.

*Would I Go Back?* Yes. Chang fen is a nice, light dish worth repeating. I‚Äôd also like to try their fried rice or stir-fry noodles. And I‚Äôm planning to slowly work my way through their ‚Äúsnacks‚Äù selections so I can keep discovering new-to-me Chinese treats. Fried bean curd roll with shrimp or ham chim peng? I‚Äôm interested.
