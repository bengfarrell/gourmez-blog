Jump'n Java Café is a coffee house/sandwich shop in RTP with brightly colored yellow, red, and green walls. They have old wooden booths, a few small tables, one large table, and conference room space in the back. I found the space inviting, and the clientele seemed to be mainly people grabbing lunch during their workday. A lot of them seemed to be regulars.

Free wireless is available. I think food is actually more the focus than coffee, as the espresso in my cappuccino was nice and bitter, but the foam was too airy with large bubbles, usually a sign that the milk was heated too hot. I prefer my foam either dry and stiff or wet and luscious. They also have macha, rooibas (red espresso), and green tea drink options.

Lunch offerings are sandwiches, teriyaki and curry bowls, and quiche, again. At least half the sandwiches have artichoke hearts as a filling, and that is a-ok with me. I have a love affair with artichoke hearts, and Jump'n Java Café does too, apparently.

I went with the Giardini sandwich, which has those artichoke hearts, tomato, broccoli, cheddar, and provolone all served on a ciabetta roll.

While the broccoli was skimped on, the artichoke and cheeses gave the sandwich great flavor, and the ciabetta was really good.

I'm intrigued by the curry bowls, and I saw a number of people digging into them, so I'll definitely be back to try that sometime, as well as the red espresso, which is something I haven't tried anywhere as yet. Jump'n Java, while not necessarily the best foam makers in the world, has a relaxed, pleasant atmosphere. It's a good place to spend an early afternoon or morning with your laptop, especially if you're craving some artichoke hearts.
