**Xpression Red Wine** Other stuff on the label: Ironstone Vineyards, 2003 California

On a beige speckled background, two pink blossoms hang out in a gold frame with matching lettering. For this wine, I followed the manufacturer's suggestion to drink it slightly chilled. If you try it colder or at room temperature, let me know if the flavors change!

The liquid is thinly red to the eye, like a fake plastic garnet. Its nose is very pleasant, smelling sweet and pungent, reminescant of a red hot gummy candy. After sipping, I discovered that the red hot comparison is apt. It's very warm in flavor but doesn't have heat beyond a teensy little kick. I imagine it's like drinking a freshly squeezed cup of persimmons; there's just that little undercurrent of light spice. It probably most resembles an Indian fruit I haven't yet encountered in the exotic section of my local grocer. It's much sweeter than it looks but tastes foreign all the same.

This wine is dangerous. It's so wonderfully sweet but is infused with unseen malice. I feel like I'm being chased by a shadow. Lucky for Ironstone, I like the thrill.
