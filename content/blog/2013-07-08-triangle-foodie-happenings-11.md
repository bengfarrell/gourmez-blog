![](http://dishcrawl.com/site_media/img/logo.png)It's time for another Triangle Foodie Happening post, in large part because [Dishcrawl](http://dishcrawl.com "Dishcrawl") is going crazy in the Bull City this week! What is Dishcrawl? It is a nationwide company that puts together one night events with the goal of focusing on a city or neighborhood's cuisines. If you are thinking food tourism, you are right! But Dishcrawl has a twist: the four restaurants that are featured remain a secret until that evening's tour. Dishcrawl first came to Raleigh in the spring, but now it's set its sights on Durham, and demand has been so high, they added a second night for back-to-back events. I'll be joining on a press pass on **7/9 at 7 pm for the Five Points Feast.** Want to meet up with me and Dishcrawl? There are still a few tickets left [here](http://dishcrawl.com/fivepointsencore/ "Dishcrawl Five Points"): $45 gets you four courses, and vegetarians can be accommodated. The originally scheduled event, on 7/10, is sold out so Tuesday night is your only chance!

Only chance for Durham, that is. Dishcrawl is also holding an event in Raleigh in July. On **7/24 at 7:00 pm the historic Moore Square** district will be the tour's focus. Tickets are again $45 and include four courses at four restaurants, locations to be revealed. Locations will remain secret until the reveal, but I can guess a few likely suspects..[.get your tickets here!](http://dishcrawl.com/raleigh/)

What more do you need to know than summer-fresh tomatoes? How about that it's six courses for only $49? If you're a drinker, that'll be $75 with wine pairings, and the menu is as follows:

- Reception, BLT Bite, Las Lilas Vinho Verde Blanco, Portugal, 2012
- 1st Course, Coon Rock Farm Heirloom Tomato & Vegetable Gazpacho, possibly Michlits Frizzante Pinot Noir Rose
- 2nd Course, Coon Rock Farm & Wild Onion Farm Heirloom Tomatoes: Cherokee Purple, German Green, Chocolate Stripe, Persimmon, Virginia Sweets & Richard’s Black with Chapel Hill Creamery Fresh Mozzarella Cheese, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Fresh Basil, and Sweet Balsamic Vinegar Glaze Wine, and likely the Domaine de Aubuisieres Cuvee de Silex Vouvray,(Chenin Blanc) Loire Valley, France 2011
- 3rd Course, Assorted Heirloom Tomatoes Stuffed with Rabbit and Sweet Corn Served on a Bed of Creamy Sweet Corn Risotto with a yet to be determined Pinot Noir, from the Willamette Valley, OR
- 4th Course, Harris Robinette Ribeye of Beef Roasted with Caramelized Onions and Tomato Guts, Served with Grilled Eggplant, Grilled Squash, Roasted New Potatoes and Finished with Over Dried Amish Paste Roma Tomatoes with a yet to be determined Zinfandel probably from Napa Valley, CA
- 5th Course, Sungold Tomato Panna Cotta almost certainly with La Spinetta Bricco Quaglia Moscato D’Asti, Piedmont Italy 2012

Bartenders will pair up with baristas to create the perfect cocktail made with Larry's cold-brew coffee. For $5, you can sample their shots and get in on the judging. Now that's a deal! It's taking place at Foundation downtown, and [more info can be found here](https://www.facebook.com/events/465345810219646/).
