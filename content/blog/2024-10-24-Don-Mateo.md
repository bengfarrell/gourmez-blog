*The Vibe:* Don Mateo Salvadorean & Mexican Cuisine is a longtime favorite among residents of Tieton, WA, a cute artist & agricultural town where my mom and stepfather live. It's always wise to call ahead to make sure they're open, as hours vary. But they are usually open 9:00am to mid-afternoon or early evening, except for Sundays.

Don Mateo is painted a vivid dark forest green. You'll find it just off the Tieton main square, by the "Tie-It-On" Apples mural. Inside are roughly six tables. It's not likely to be busy, but they do a brisk to-go business. My parents have enjoyed them for years, and my sister and I make a point to try them at least once on each visit.

Be sure to scrutinize the menu before orderingâ€”they offer takes on some dishes that'll be unusual for non-Salvadoreans, such as the enchiladas (described below) and taquitos (more like street tacos).

# My Take on Don Mateo

*The Food:* Pretty darn good! I recall having the pupusas in the past and enjoying the filled flatbreads themselves, but being less enthused by the strong vinegar in the requisite curtido (pickled cabbage salad) topping. Though I liked their jalapeno kick!

On this trip, I tried a few different options. The aforementioned enchiladas reminded me of the current quesabirria craze in California, probably because we chose beef for the filling.

Crispy cheese decorated the mildly greasy sauce-dipped tacos full of more beef and cheese. I liked them, but I'd have preferred a longer cook on the tortillasâ€”I prefer my tortillas less damp when they are intended to be eaten by hand.

I quite liked the flautas:

They come filled with chicken and cheese by default, and four is a hefty serving, with a lettuce and cotija salad included. Excellent crunch, good flavor, no notes. ðŸ˜‰

Also exceptional were the street tacos (note: they are not the same as the taquitos, though similarly described). I opted for shredded chicken.

These were served differently than pictured on the menu. Three rather large and perfectly soft corn tortillas were stuffed full of juicy chicken, along with onions and cilantro. The dish also comes with rice, so is quite filling. The rice is fluffy with a soothing broth flavor.

My parents love the carne asada burritos and usually split one between themselves, as it isâ€¦drumrollâ€¦ plenty filling. They also go crazy for their horchata, which comes in large cups.

*Would I Go Back?* Oh, that's a given! I hope Don Mateo stays in business forever in Tieton, because my parents love them and because I look forward to them each visit. Plus, I still need to try their Salvadorean chow mein and plantains.
