**Broadbent Vinho Verde** Portugal

[![Broadbent Vinho Verde](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2013/01/Broadbent-Vinho-Verde.jpg)](http://www.thegourmez.com/2013/02/broadbent-vinho-verde/broadbent-vinho-verde-2/)

I love Vinho Verde. Wine made from its or Torrontes's grapes convinced me I’d given white wines too hard of a time when they became popular in the last few years. So I’m always happy to try another bottle of the stuff. The Broadbent Vinho Verde has a delicious nose of limes, minerals, and flowers. The minerals are especially strong.

On drinking, a bubbly undercurrent surprises me. It's not bothersome, though it makes the lime more astringent. That lime is predominant in the glass. The secondary flavors are kumquat and dandelion stems—yes, I am well familiar with dandelion stems from my childhood. Fleeting sweetness gives way to a lively tartness with a quinine tang.

This wine has a lot of typical Vinho Verde characteristics, but it’s too astringent and too lacking in anything else of note to be a keeper for me. There are much better Vinho Verde options.

The aromas in this wine are an intriguing mix of sweet citrus, clover and spring greens. You get a bit of a tingle on the tongue from the light-but-persistent fizz. Sweet melon and tangerine flavors play against bright lemon and lime. This is a charming wine that's lean and lively but not austere.

The Broadbent delivers excellent value with a down to earth attitude. The zesty, crisp, citrusy fruit notes are fun to give a quick swish in your mouth. Your cheeks salivate as the slight effervescence wakes up your palate. Floral and pear-like, Broadbent is not a sweet wine but a flavorful nectar that feels like biting into a fresh spring day.

This delightful wine (at a great price) opens with the impression of a light sparkling wine and that is confirmed in the mouth with fairly significant spritz. A touch of fresh green apple and a clean finish makes this a great quaffer.

**Last Thoughts from the Gourmez:** My compatriots clearly disagree with me on this wine! It may be worth your Vinho-Verde-loving glass after all.
