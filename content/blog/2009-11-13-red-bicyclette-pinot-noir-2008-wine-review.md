Wine: **Red Bicyclette Pinot Noir 2008** Region: Languedoc-Roussillon, France

![](http://www.thegourmez.com/gourmez/photos/redbicyclette002.jpg)

The nose smells of chocolate and berry. It tastes like biting into a packaged cherry danish that has been dipped in chocolate donut glaze. Both the spice and the texture are rather thin. I don't like the chocolate aftertaste (shocking, I know). It's an adequate wine that lacks substance.

**Other Bloggers' Thoughts:**

There are several reviews out there for earlier vintages but not for the 2008.
