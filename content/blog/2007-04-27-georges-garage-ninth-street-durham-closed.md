**George's Garage** \*CLOSED\* 9th Street 737 9th Street Durham, NC www.ghgrestaurants.com/garage/garage.html Entrees $15--$28

George's Garage is one of the many Giorgio's Hospitality Group restaurants. This one is similar to Spice Street in that it's a mix of sushi bar, lounge area, and main dining room. The lounge looked cozy, with warm, dim lighting, and I was quickly saddened that we chose to sit in the dining room instead. It was garishly bright. I felt like I was in a warehouse with bright yellow walls that was populated with families who wanted to see and be seen. So, if that's what you like, you should really check it out.

Mr. Gourmez' sashimi platter was very pretty but as I'm not a big fan of raw food, I didn't sample it. I had the coldwater swordfish with linguini in a spicy clam sauce and I loved it. The steak was perfectly peppered. The sauce was very light yet full of rich flavor. I wasn't hungry but couldn't help cleaning the plate.

My meal was accompanied by an [Alex Martini](http://www.thegourmez.com/gourmez/cocktails/review.php?id=12&type=), which got high marks. Overall, the bland atmosphere was overshadowed by dishes that definitely exceeded expectations. I'll just sit by the bar next time.
