I don't normally post the press releases that I get, especially the travel ones because they are priced far above what I'd ever consider, much less what most of my readers would, I'm sure. But I found the idea of this travel opportunity enchanting--and I'm only 40% introvert!  So if you, too, love the concept of a mindful, relaxing vacation to Glastonbury and you've got the cash, check it out!

The rest of this post is taken directly from the Sacred Introvert website, where you can purchase tickets. [Click here](http://sacredintrovert.com/home/retreat-tour-2/sacred-introvert-retreat-tour-glastonbury/). You have until March 16, 2015 to sign up.

Sacred Introvert Retreat Tour to Glastonbury England, The Great Kingdom of Wessex and Beyond…

_“The First Travel Experience for Introverts by Introverts.”_

**May 1st – 10th 2015**

**About**

The Sacred Introvert Retreat Tour to [Glastonbury England](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glastonbury), the Great Kingdom of Wessex and beyond takes in many majestic places, some more well known and some off the beaten path. But all at a pace and space an introvert will appreciate. Traveling in our own private and [![retreat1](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2015/01/retreat1.jpg)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2015/01/retreat1.jpg)comfortable motor coach we will always bear the introvert perspective in mind leaving ample time to have your own experience wherever we go. There is no rushing from place to place and no tour guide barking over your thoughts.  In addition to days out every other day is a “local” day. A day where you can just recharge in the peaceful and green surroundings of the [Glastonbury Abbey Retreat.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glastonbury_Abbey) Set in 36 acres of parkland the retreat is home to ponds, orchards, wildlife, their own bee colony, a museum and the ruins of the 7th century Abbey. This is your home for 10 days.

**Glastonbury** itself is a lively market town replete with bookstores, cafes, curio shops and market days. It is known not only for a yearly music festival but more so as a pilgrimage spot with powerful earth energies and a strong connection to the legends of King Arthur and the Holy Grail. On a local day you can opt for a trek up to the top of the [Glastonbury Tor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glastonbury_Tor) (conical hill). Known at Ynys yr Afalon by the Celtic Britons, the tor is believed by some to be the the mystical Isle of Avalon and the place King Arthur went for his final rest. Sit atop in the roofless ruin of St. Michael’s Church and take in the vista that stretches for miles on a clear day. Or choose to relax in the lush and fragrant Chalice Well Gardens home of the “Red Spring”. The iron rich water is taken as a healing treatment by people who come from all over just to drink it fresh from the source.

[The Chalice Well](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalice_Well) itself is also said to be the place where the Holy Grail is hidden, another reason people claim the water runs red hued. You can walk the labyrinth at St. John’s Church or amble up [Wearyall Hill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glastonbury_Thorn); another mysterious spot where  Joseph of Arimathea reputedly struck his staff in the ground declaring we are “Weary all” and out of it a tree, the Glastonbury Holy Thorn, sprouted.

**![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2015/01/new_tor.jpg)The White Spring,** housed in a Victorian stone building opposite the Red Spring, is cool, wet, dark and magical. Many locals bathe in the White Spring. You can too if you if you choose to test the icy waters.

The 11th century **St. Margaret’s Church** and Almshouse are housed on quaint manicured grounds and are open for private reflection and respite. Or seek out “Gog and Magog”, two ancient Oaks side by side across the vale called “Paradise” along a wooded path below the Tor. There are also a number of grade listed buildings in Glastonbury that are available for your inspection. Some of note are the Rural Life Museum, the Medieval Tribunal, the Abbot’s Kitchen (on the grounds of the Abbey Retreat) and the [George and Pilgrims Inn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Hotel_and_Pilgrims'_Inn,_Glastonbury).

**The local bus system** is easy to navigate and available if you are feeling adventurous and want to explore a neighboring town at your own pace. But you may choose to spend your local days on the grounds of our home at the Abbey. The retreat exterior has a decidedly “Downton Abbey” feel but the grounds and 7th century ruined Abbey could take a few days on its own to get to know well.

We will also have informal **group yoga and mediation** opportunities each local day. On “days out” our itinerary will be varied but will consist of a leisurely combination of the highlights listed in detail. On days out the kitchen will provide us with a customized sack lunch to take along for al fresco picnics in the verdant landscape. ![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2015/01/abbey_4.jpg)  Every attendee of the Sacred Introvert Retreat Tour gets their own private room. There are NO single supplement fees. The rooms at the Abbey are English bed and breakfast style meaning there are wash basins in the rooms but bathrooms are shared. This is common for most B&B accommodations outside of cities in the UK (and Europe) and very easy to navigate. The ratio of rooms to baths at the Abbey is 2 rooms to one bath. We also have a very limited number of double rooms for companions traveling together who would prefer to share. The rooms are simple with no televisions or phones and set up for reflection and introspection with no distractions. There are also quiet and comfortable common rooms with many corners to curl up and be private in public or to meet a fellow introvert traveler for tea and a chat.

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2015/01/abbey_12.jpg)**All meals and beverages** (non alcoholic) are included in the Sacred Introvert Retreat Tour and are freshly prepared each day in the Abbey’s kitchen with locally sourced ingredients. All dietary requirements will be addressed with food available for every palate and preference. You are not required to eat every meal at the Abbey and can choose to venture out into town and try the local fare. (meals, beverages and snacks outside the Abbey are NOT included in your Retreat Tour price) Meals will be served at specific times during our stay and will be indicated in your orientation package upon arrival.

The beauty of the Sacred Introvert Retreat Tour is you are never required to participate in anything. This is your time. If you choose to stay “home” on a day out you are respected and honored for your choice. The goal of the Sacred Introvert Retreat Tour is to provide the setting for “Quality Intimacy” with the self, with others and with nature. The opportunity for authentic connections with like minded individuals, unique surroundings and natural landscapes with the comfort of your own private room to retreat to whenever you want will provide the space for that quality intimacy.

Evening Events

* * *

- **Night Walk Up the Tor** _Don’t forget to pack a torch (that’s flashlight for Americans!) for our night walk up the Tor. Stargazing in dark skies and hopefully we’ll spot a badger or two._
- **Pub Night at the George and Pilgrims Inn** _Built in the 15th Century and reputedly haunted the first drink is on Sacred Introvert._
- **Bonfire Night** _A perfect time for quiet introspection as we experience the Abbey Retreat gardens at night around a roaring fire._
- **The Introvert Paradox** _First offered by Lisa Avebury in 2013, this interactive talk explores many facets of life as an introvert and how we can offer our unique talents and special gifts to the world._

**Highlights**

- Private group tour to the inner ring of [Stonehenge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonehenge). Access is restricted to the general public. We will be visiting as a group for alone time after hours within the enigmatic ancient ring. Along the way to Stonehenge we will pass for a stop at [Woodhenge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodhenge) and [Durrington Walls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durrington_Walls). Both sites are part of the ancient landscape that make up the Stonehenge World Heritage Site.
- Noted as the largest stone circle in Europe, bigger in circumference then Stonehenge, and surrounded by rolling green countryside and friendly sheep the [Avebury Stone Circle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avebury) contains the small village of Avebury in it’s center. Ample time will be given for personal walks and reflections among the stones along with the Tolkein Trees. These trees are rumored to be the author’s inspiration for the walking trees in the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit books.
- Less then one mile from Avebury we will visit the [West Kennet Long Barrow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Kennet_Long_Barrow). This chambered neolithic tomb predates Stonehenge by 400 years. On our way back we will take in the mysterious [Silbury Hill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silbury_Hill), a prehistoric chalk mound built by the ancients for what we still don’t have a clue!
- The [City of Wells](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells,_Somerset) is often referred to as “The Smallest City in England” due to having one of the most majestic cathedrals to be found anywhere on this planet. This picturesque walkable market town is also home to the reputed oldest purely residential street in the world the “Vicar’s Close”. Ample time will be allotted for strolls along the moat that circles the Bishop’s Palace and for seeking out the many carved figures that live on the cathedral walls.
- Cited as one of the world’s most beautiful small cities our visit to Bath includes a tour through the ancient [Roman Baths](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Baths_(Bath)) with extra time to spend as you like visiting [Bath Abbey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath_Abbey) or just strolling the sweeping street known as the [Royal Crescent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Crescent) with its grand Georgian architecture.
- Named the second greatest natural wonder in Britain the three mile long [Cheddar Gorge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheddar_Gorge) is Britain’s version of a grand canyon. Take in the beautiful vistas as we motor through the gorge and stop in the village for a sample of Cheddar’s famous namesake.
- The [Stanton Drew Stone Circle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanton_Drew_stone_circles) is off the beaten path yet it is the second largest stone circle in Britain next to Avebury. The tiny village of Stanton Drew is chock full of 13th to 15th century grade listed buildings. Not to be missed is the local pub “The Druids Arms”. In their garden is a group of three large ancient standings stones known as “The Cove”. An excellent spot for a pint and a ponder.
- Following in the footsteps of ancient Britons along what is known as the oldest road “The Ridgeway” we will be heading to the “[Vale of the White Horse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vale_of_White_Horse)”. Made up of three ancient sites we will be meandering through [Wayland’s Smithy Long Barrow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland's_Smithy), the [Uffington White Horse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uffington_White_Horse) and[Uffington Castle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uffington_Castle).  This is a day to wear good walking shoes – and the sweeping views will make it all worthwhile.
