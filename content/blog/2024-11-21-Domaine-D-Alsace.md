These two sparking wines come from the Orschwihr region of the Alsatians. The Lucien Albrecht family has been making wines there since 1698. *Crémante* is the official designation for sparkling wines of the region, which has been an AOC (appellation d'originie controlee) for 48 years now.

# Thoughts on Tasting the Lucien Albrecht Crémante D'Alsace Brut

[![lucien albrecht cremant d'alsace brut sparkling wine](https://thegourmez-wpmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/11/Albrecht-2024-sized(10).jpg)](https://thegourmez-wpmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/11/Albrecht-2024-sized(10).jpg)

*Grapes:* Pinot blanc and auxerrois

*Age at Review:* 3 years

*Most memorable flavors?* Oh, this is easy drinking. Big round bubbles are on offer with golden apple and pear notes. There's lime acidity on the finish. This is a great opening wine, setting the stage for more fun to come throughout the evening.

*Image conjured up?* A bread roll with a sweet cream glaze thinly spread on top.

*What would I pair it with?* Appetizers: pigs in a blanket, crackers and cheese.

*What* **did** *I pair it with?* I made a cranberry-thyme simple syrup to go with this, along with Campari and lemon. Definitely worked well as a spritzer!

*Would I drink it again?* Yes, I quite liked the flavor profile. And it's an affordable wine with plenty of depth.

*At this \$23 price?* That's a steal. Do it.

# Thoughts on Tasting the Lucien Albrecht Domaine Crémant D'Alsace Rosé

*Grapes:* Pinot noir

*Age at Review:* 3 years

*Most memorable flavors?* I want to say it tastes of brambleberry, because it offers a thin, but wild, fruit flavor at first sip. There are also lemon and light pastry notes. Medium-bodied bubbles pass quickly out of the glass, but that may have been because I had it in a short coupe.

*Image conjured up?* Toaster strudels with a light brushing of vanilla glaze.

*What would I pair it with?* Honestly, this is probably a great breakfast wine.

*What* **did** *I pair it with?* Watching the horror film, *the Coffee Table*.

*Would I drink it again?* Yes, but it was perhaps past its prime—that's my fault, as my wine reviews took a pause during the COVID years. Look for newer bottlings.

*At this \$23 price?* I'd be more inclined to buy the Lucien Albrecht Domaine Crémant D'Alsace Brut for myself. But the rosé is problem a great introduction to sparkling rosé wines for new drinkers. It may not bowl them over, but rather, will invite them in for an enjoyable, cozy evening.

Or maybe my cat will invite them in for a glass.
