My second post for _Localwise's_ blog went up last week. This one draws a fair bit from my recent visits to urban wineries [Urban Legend](http://thegourmez.com/2015/07/28/urban-legend-cellars-tasting/) and [Jeff Cohn Cellars](http://thegourmez.com/2015/07/16/jeff-cohn-cellars/), with fellow wine writer Peter Nowack of [Bung R. Cooper.](http://www.bungrcooper.com/) Knowing there were a few other urban wineries in easy walking distance of the Jack London Square neighborhood of Oakland, I came up with this suggested tour.

It begins,

> Oakland is known for many things—the most diversity in the USA, being the home of the [2015 NBA champions](http://www.nba.com/warriors/), [Lake Merritt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Merritt), and much more. Wine is not yet on that list, but I’d argue that it should be.
> 
> Jack London Square alone boasts four urban wineries and tasting rooms within a mile and a half stretch. For me, that means one thing: Walking Tour!
