# Thoughts on Tasting the 2020 Quinta da Fonte Souto Blanco

*Most memorable flavors?* Warm applesauce. Lime. Pineapple and lemongrass. Chilled, it has a thicker body than it does at room temperature. This makes sense as the wine was aged on the lees in oak barrels, meaning it was in contact with yeast and wood, both of which provide buttery notes and thicker mouthfeel. But the few months it spent in stainless steel assured that its minerality and acidity would shine among those more savory notes.

*Image conjured up?* At room temperature, I imagined a pineapple and lemongrass paleta, with lime zest mixed throughout. Chilled, that paleta is richer, with a buttery custard base.

*What would I pair it with?* Would be great with tropical sorbets, maybe coconut. I can also see it served alongside buttery bread rolls.

*What* did *I pair it with?* A hot Bay Area day.

*Would I drink it again?* Sure. Nothing off about this blend.

*At this \$26 price?* That’s more questionable for me. The price is affordable, but I’m not sure I enjoyed the wine enough to seek it out on my own.

*Reviewed August 2025.*
