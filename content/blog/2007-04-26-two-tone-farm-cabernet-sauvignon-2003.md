**Two Tone Farm Cabernet Sauvignon** Other stuff on the label: 2003, California

The label looks like a frame out of a bad horror film. It's an old two door car, pulling out and heading into the unknown. Drinking the wine is a similar experience.

It smells of licorice and palm trees, which is very unusual in my limited wine tasting career. The spice is somewhere on the pepper tree between cayenne and paprika.

Overall, I'd describe the flavor as that of a whorehound candy, with a hint of rum.Â It's complex, but not necessarily delicious.
