The William and John (W. & J.) Graham family first produced Graham's Port in 1820, starting a long legacy of excellent port making. They had 40 years of experience by the time a Scottish lad with the surname of Symington joined their team. Nearly a hundred years later, the Symington Family of winemakers purchased the Graham estates and name. The Symingtons have released W. & J. Graham's Port for another 25 years, to today. That's 225 years of making port under this label!

All ports are fortified wines made from a particular blend of red grapes. Tawny ports are aged longer in oak barrels than ruby ports, which spend more time aging in the bottle. Tawny ports typically have nut, caramel, and dried fruit notes. A 10-year-old tawny like this one has spent 10 years in the barrel before it's bottled and released to consumers.

# Thoughts on Tasting Graham's 10-Year-Old Tawny Port

![port sipper](https://thegourmez-wpmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/2025/2/grahams-tawny-2025+(1).jpg)

*Most memorable flavors?* Date, coconut, light brown sugar on the nose. Date is strong on the palate and pecan nuttiness comes next. Then caramel as rich as its coloring.

*Image conjured up?* A luxurious end to an evening of fine dining.

*What would I pair it with?* Bread pudding calls out, but it honestly might be too rich in combination with that dessert. Go for a Spanish cheese plate with honey, pecans, and chorizo. Or maybe pancakes!

*What* **did** *I pair it with?* Admiration. I love a good port, and this one has deepened with a little extra aging past its 10 years at bottling.

*Would I drink it again?* Is it port? Then yes, absolutely.

*At this \$39 price?* I think that's right about where it should be in terms of value. I'd pick up a bottle, for sure.
