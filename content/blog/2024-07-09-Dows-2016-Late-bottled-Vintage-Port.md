The Dow’s 2016 Late Bottled Vintage Port is one of many Dow ports that I have tried and enjoyed—I do honestly wonder what it would take for me to *dislike* a Port. This one is an exceptionally good deal for a wine that would make a lovely end to a full day. It will only get better with time.

## Thoughts on Tasting Dow’s 2016 Late Bottled Vintage Port

*Would I drink it again?* Yes!

*At this $26 price?* That’s a steal, to be honest.

*Most memorable flavors?* This is a lighter Port than most, with notes of caramelized strawberries and burnt toast combined with raisin, prune, and white chocolate.

*Image conjured up?* A caramelized French toast that’s crunchy from being grilled just a bit too long. Just add the maple syrup.

*Reviewed 2 October 2022.*
