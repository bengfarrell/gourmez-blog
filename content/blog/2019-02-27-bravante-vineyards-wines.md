[Bravante Vineyards](http://www.bravantevineyards.com/) has been producing wine for nearing twenty years on Howell Mountain, in the eastern Napa Valley. Their small selection of wines is all estate-grown, from either the Stone Ridge or Black Oak vineyards. Duane Dappen, who owns [D-Cubed Cellars](http://thegourmez.com/2018/10/09/d-cubed-cellars-zinfandel/) and has been making wines since his 4-H club days, is their winemaker.

Shall we drink?

##### The Reviews

**Bravante Vineyards 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon**

[![bravante, vineyards, bravante wines, cellars, cabernet sauvignon, trio, red wine blend, bordeaux, napa valley, howell mountain, tasting notes, review](https://thegourmez-wpmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/02/IMG_20181214_154703-358x500.jpg)](https://thegourmez-wpmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/02/IMG_20181214_154703.jpg)I like the classic style of this label--just simple, beautiful silver grapes on a field of black. The wine itself is mainly cabernet sauvignon with merlot added for blending. Its color is an inky reddish-purple blend. Depth of flavor is achieved; you can taste the trowel heading down into the vineyard's soil. The wine's body is remarkably thin for a cabernet sauvignon. Shriveled berries come to mind on tasting; perhaps elderberry and currants left to sun-dry on the bush. Blackberry is present as a suggestion rather than a statement, like looking at a spent bush in winter and dreaming of it being heavily laden with berries come summer. Some cranberry acidity and green peppercorns finish it off.

**My score:**

**Bravante Vineyards 2013 Trio**

[![bravante, vineyards, bravante wines, cellars, cabernet sauvignon, trio, red wine blend, bordeaux, napa valley, howell mountain, tasting notes, review](https://thegourmez-wpmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/02/IMG_20181214_153247-359x500.jpg)](https://thegourmez-wpmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/02/IMG_20181214_153247.jpg)This Bordeaux-style blend of merlot, cabernet sauvignon, and cabernet franc makes for very easy drinking. It's so well blended, you might worry about a loss of personality. But only for a moment, as the fresh blackberry and plum notes are quickly complemented with mocha and a slight pull of roasted nopales. It's tasty!
