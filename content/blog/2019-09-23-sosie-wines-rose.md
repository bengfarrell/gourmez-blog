So why not do it with one more glass of rosé for the season? Here are my thoughts on Sosie Wines Rosé of Syrah 2017, should you need convincing. **_Obligatory disclaimer:_** This wine was a free sample for my review.

Not to worry – no fur or feathers made it into the glass, just lovely dusky pink with copper tones. It smells of guava and strawberry. The wine feels medium-bodied and buttery on the tongue, with prominent guava and a bounty of freshly washed skipping stones. Think of a guava half broiled just long enough to caramelize a few drops of juice. Serve that up with strawberries dipped in cream. The backbone of stony acidity provides enough balance to keep you from feeling guilty for this dessert.

Blue cheese would also be a great choice. So would a fluffy egg scramble with leeks, if you're feeling adventurous.
