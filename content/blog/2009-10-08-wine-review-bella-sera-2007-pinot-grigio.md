Wine:  **Bella Sera 2007 Pinot Grigio** Region:  Dollo Venizie, Italy

![](http://www.rebeccagomezfarrell.com/gourmez/photos/bellasera.jpg)

This pinot grigio smells of sweet and crisp honeydew. It tastes minerally with some undertones of green pear and a dash of vanilla thrown in for good measure.  There's also an aftertaste like you've just eaten a tart lemon cream cookie.  I'd like another, please.

> I found this delightful Pinot light and crisp. With a hint of pear which was very nice. Refreshing for a hot summer day!

> Goes great with appetizers, light pastas, fish and chicken.

> Cheap Italian PG with Domino’s Pizza. Just fine.  Swell, actually.   Subtle tropical fruit, faint lime and such.  Cheap.  Not the best cheap Italian PG, but cheap Italian PG, none-the-less.  It’s s’okay.
