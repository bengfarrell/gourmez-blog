Wine: **Elkin Creek Vineyard Dessert Wine** Region: Yadkin Valley, NC

This dessert wine smells of boysenberries and blueberries. It tastes like boysenberry syrup- rich, thick, and in need of pancakes.

Overall, too thick to really enjoy as a wine for me, but sweet enough to make it worth my while.

Nothing. I couldn't find any reviews of this one, likely because it's from a small, but lovely, NC winery.
