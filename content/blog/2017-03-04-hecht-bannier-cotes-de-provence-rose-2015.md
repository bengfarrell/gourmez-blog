I am a firm believer in the rosé any day philosophy, but on a day like this one full of sunshine after a long spat of drought-breaking rain, it’s especially appealing. Aside from the beautiful pink glow, the first thing I notice on drinking the Hecht & Bannier Côtes de Provence Rosé 2015 is an extremely velvety, or is that buttery, mouthfeel. That yields a bevy of strawberry and raspberry notes that recall any number of Jell-O parfait desserts. It’s the sort of sweet finish to a meal for which one helping is plenty, but that helping leaves you happy.

At $19, perhaps this should be an any fortnight rosé rather than an any day one, if you’re on a budget. Though the glass bottle stopper is a nice extra touch.

The fresh and inviting nose has cherries, strawberries, wet stone minerals, white peach, orange zest, fennel and anise. This has light to medium body with good acidity and just a hint of lingering sweetness. On the palate strawberry, cherry, and minerals quickly take control with white peach and fennel coming in later. The long finish adds orange zest and a hint of anise. This is a crisp wine with just enough sweetness to add a bit of weight and make it extremely easy to sip. 90 pts.

The pale pink Hecht & Bannier Côtes de Provence Rosé 2015 has great acidity, minerality, and lovely flavors of raspberry, pink grapefruit, rosewater, and a subtle touch of lavender.
