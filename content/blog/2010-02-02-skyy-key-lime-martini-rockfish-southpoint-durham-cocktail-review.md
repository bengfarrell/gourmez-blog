Made with Skyy Vodka, this drink is a good addition to my list of key lime pie martinis in the area. The lime flavor was sweet and mellow, though I wouldn't have minded some more tartness. It was frothed up with milk, poured in a martini glass that was rimmed with delicious graham cracker crumbs, and then dusted with nutmeg and cinnamon. Though it wouldn't have been as pretty, I'd have liked the spices shaken up with the drink rather than sprinkled on top, so they didn't clump at the bottom, as is so often the case when spices are used in cocktail. Otherwise, though, delish!
