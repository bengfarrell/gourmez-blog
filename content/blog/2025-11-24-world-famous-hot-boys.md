## The 411 on World Famous Hotboys

*Address:* 1601 San Pablo Ave\
Oakland, CA

\-and-

27826 Mission Blvd\
Hayward, CA

(they have more locations, even a few in Indiana now, but those are the ones I’ve been to and review here)

*The Vibe:* World Famous Hotboys is Oakland’s answer to the hot chicken sandwich craze. I first tried their sandwiches when they were cooking at [the Forage Kitchen incubator](https://www.foragekitchen.com/) in uptown Oakland, circa 2018. They earned tons of hype for their gigantic fried chicken sandwiches that come doused in spicy rubs and layered with pickles and coleslaw in a bounteous bun. The sheer size of that sandwich defeated me then, but years have passed, and I wanted to try again. So I went to the source: their first permanent location in Oakland.

That shop just screams Oakland, y’all. Between the mural, the colors, and the volume of people waiting for their orders, you know you’re somewhere good food is made. Order at the window and wait your turn. It may take around 20 minutes as they *are* popular and they take their time making those good eats.

But if you’re in Hayward, where I went even more recently as it’s closer to me, you might miss the restaurant altogether! That’s because it’s a food truck completely covered in graffiti and permanently stationed inside the parking lot of a convenience store.

You’ll need a keen eye to find them, but the Hotboys name and logo are on that truck. I had to do a second take to be sure I was in the right place. Also, other folks walking past the food truck was my only clue that there’s a nook with more tables nearby.

It’s quite a peaceful spot for lunch if you can find it!

## My Take on World Famous Hotboys

*The Food:* World Famous Hotboys makes a great hot chicken sandwich. The “sando” is offered with dark meat while the “chicken tender sandwich” is white meat, which is what I prefer so that’s what I’ve tried. They offer seven different spice rankings and recommend Medium + for folks who like it spicy. That’s what I chose when I ordered my sandwich at the Oakland spot, along with a delicious watermelon aqua fresca.

I do like heat, but I think the Medium + is a good call as an upper limit—I was crying, and that’s rare for me. Crying in a good way, of course! But there were moments when I thought I may have aimed too high . . . what I’m saying is I’m glad I resisted the Hot.

Serving coleslaw on the sandwich is key, as its creaminess has a tempering effect on the spice. The pickles add flavor, but I do think there may be too much “money sauce” squirted on top. I did appreciate the sauce’s creamy assistance in battling the spice, however! The sauce tasted like a chipotle and 1000 Island blend. The pickles were good, but the bun bread was just okay for me.

That chicken meat is tender and plentiful, which is sometimes a feat for white meat and definitely a plus. Because I’m counting calories and the bread wasn’t that memorable, I decided to try a chicken finger meal the next time I went instead. Which is just what I did at the Hayward food truck.

That picture isn’t taken from the best angle, but I could swear that the chicken tender meal has more chicken than the sandwich, and those were THICK tenders, let me tell you. Each one had to weigh at least 4 ounces. You can’t see it, but the tenders come with a piece of Texas-toast-style white bread and pickles on the side.

I decided to give my tear ducts a break and went for Medium this time. I teared up once . . . but I swear it was the sun. LOL. For me, including toast is extraneous, as I ordered a chicken tender combo specifically to avoid bread. But a plain slice of white bread is a very southern touch, so I can’t hand out a demerit for my personal preference. I just didn’t eat it.

The crinkle-cut fries come tossed in an addicting and light Cajun seasoning. They’re served with the same money dipping sauce that comes on top of the sandwich. I liked it more for dipping than poured on the sandwich.

*Would I Go Back?* Yes. For me, World Famous Hotboys is best enjoyed for its chicken tenders rather than for the full sandwich. But I am excited to find the perfect side to go with those tenders: they have a pimento mac and cheese, collards, and étouffée, too. Not to mention the wild fry dishes like Guap Fries with a cheese sauce or Swamp and Hoosier fries, made with collards and chicken-sage gravy, respectively. Plus, they fry bonuts, which are donuts made of biscuit dough, which is how my household made them growing up. Do theirs measure up to Mom’s? Someday, I will find out!
