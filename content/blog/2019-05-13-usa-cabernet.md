Let that sway you however it may.

As Peter, an English transplant, put it, he likes cabernet and he likes the USA – combining the two seemed a natural fit for his next venture. And of course, the suggested price is $17.76. That an Englishman is profiting from the product just makes it all the richer in wryness.

So is the Huckster pulling a fast one with this vino?

I don't think so. I tried the 2016 USA Cabernet on two separate occasions: during that wine dinner at [the Magic Flute](http://www.magicfluteristorante.com/) in San Francisco's Presidio Heights neighborhood and again with plenty of decanting at home.

Mild pepper, annatto, and mace spices came out with a tease of black raspberry licorice drops. There were layers, but only if you wanted to seek them.

I found notes of strawberry and passionfruit with mocha in the nose. The mocha weathered a quick wave of spice and tart berry that passionfruit supplanted. Sugared cinnamon, cardamom, and vanilla powder added depth.

At that price point, USA Cabernet offers plenty to peruse at your leisure or to enjoy in balance with little thought. With [the Scotto family's](https://thegourmez.com/?s=scotto) cabernet sauvignon, barbera, and petit verdot grapes out of Lodi, Calaveras, and Lake County, an intriguing mélange of flavors resides in the glass.

If you enjoy USA Cabernet, and I certainly did, be assured that USA Rosé and Chardonnay can't be too far in our futures. Heck, maybe Peter will even attempt a USA Gamay someday? I'll stop now with the wordplay.

Alas, this blog post is over, but your own fascination with assonant wine label names may be just beginning. Cheers.
