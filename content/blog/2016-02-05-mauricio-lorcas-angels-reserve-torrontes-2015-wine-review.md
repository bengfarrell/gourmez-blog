**Mauricio Lorca’s Angel’s Reserve Torrontes 2015** La Rioja, Argentina

## **Wine Review:**

Brine sneaks into the clam chowder in this glass. The intense acidity makes me contemplate inserting sizzling grasslands into my next fantasy story. As the wine settles, cream comes in, making that chowder New Jersey in style, with enough vegetal taste to account for the asparagus. The fruit is Braeburn apple and jackfruit.

This is a NakedWines.Com wine, which means you can only get it through their website.

## **Other Bloggers’ Thoughts:**

[My Kings Court](http://mykingscourt.com/tag/white-wine/) on the 2013

Taste – Honeysuckle and pear again but this time some citrus notes shine through. Finish – Medium but still very refreshing and really rounded with balanced acid. Overall, this is probably one of the best wines that I have ever gotten from Naked Wines. It went well with the tuna but still had a medium-enough body that it was okay to drink when it is cold out. It still would be a great summer wine with any meal. I wouldn’t join Naked Wines just for this wine, but if they offered me more free wine, I would pick this one again. B+

Citrus, light body, minerals, spice (think peppery). This wine has all of these and more. It made us think that it would be awesome with a light brunch that included cantaloupe or honeydew melon. It would also pair well with spicy Thai noodle or curry dishes. Will buy again for summer nights where cold and crisp is the requirement. 3.5/5
