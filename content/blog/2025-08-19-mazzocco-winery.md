# My Take on Mazzocco Winery

*The Vibe:* I was unexpectedly in northern Sonoma with some time to kill, and Mazzocco was able to accommodate my singleton wine tasting request. The tasting room is housed in a lovely, broad building with walls of glass and attractive architecture.

There is a raised back patio, but I was glad to see that tastings were held on the front lawn and garden this hot Saturday afternoon. It offers shadier spots, and I chose one along the path that felt like my own cozy corner among the plants and butterflies.

It was still hot under the umbrella! But the tasting room staff kept my water carafe filled.

*The Wine:* A few wines stood out among this tasting of five, with two bonus wines offered by the staff.

**Mazzocco Stuhlmuller Chardonnay Reserve 2022:** Mango and white blossoms on the nose. It’s aged 50% in old barrels and 50% in new, a technique that yields a seamless blend of fresh tropical fruit and dairy. Imagine dunking a chunk of guava into fresh, cool cream. Serve this one with dessert or a salad with a cream-based dressing.

**Mazzocco Seaton Zinfandel Reserve 2022:** A beautiful example of what to shoot for when making zinfandel. Ripe strawberries dusted with freshly ground, mild black pepper. A touch of lemongrass livens it up, and a splash of cream washes it down. Very drinkable.

Mazzocco Winery wines typically run \$30–\$90 per bottle, with most in the \$40–\$60 range.

*Would I Go Back for a \$25 tasting?* For California wine country tastings, \$25 is affordable. The wines were good, the lawn and gardens appealing, so I’d do it again. As I was a [Wilson Artisan Wine Club](https://wilsonartisanwines.com/) member at the time of this visit, it was free to me. But sure, I’d go back and pay the \$25. Maybe on a cooler day, when I can get better views of the countryside from the upper deck patio.
