**Nelsons** \*CLOSED\* Cameron Village 521 Daniels Street Raleigh, NC www.nelsonsrestaurant.com Entrees $15--$22

Nelsons is a concept restaurant, offering dining areas, a raw bar, and a sky bar. It's dressed in neutral tones that combine with the music and wall of water to make for a very relaxing meal. Presently, they are offering their raw bar menu in the dining room but that may be for a limited time only. Their menu does tend towards seafood but there are other grill options if you prefer.

My husband and I split our meal, starting with their mixed green salad with a vibrant orange vinaigrette. The cup of Gullah She Crab soup was delightful, topped with a floater of sherry to keep your tastebuds tantalized.

Our main entree was an upscale version of a clambake, which was packed with flavor from the broth. Very rich and very satisfying.

We will definitely be back to Nelsons for drinks and a snack in the sky bar, which looked perfect for a cold fall evening.
