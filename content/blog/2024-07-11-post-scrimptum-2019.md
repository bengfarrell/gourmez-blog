## Thoughts on Tasting the 2019 Prats + Symington Post Scriptum

*Most memorable flavors?* There’s definitely a strong alcohol smell at first, but nice winemaking overcomes that quickly. Berry notes are foremost: blackberries and Queen Anne’s cordial cherries. Mint and mild licorice round out this light-bodied treat.

*What would I pair it with?* A salad of prosciutto and melon with ricotta.

*Would I drink it again?* Absolutely.

*At this $27 price?* Sounds reasonable.
