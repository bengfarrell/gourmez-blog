**2 Copas Red 2009** Mendoza, Argentina

The spice of this tempranillo and malbec blend comes on too strongly at first but quickly mellows as I drink it (isn’t that somehow always the case?) Raspberries and strawberries round out that very spicy profile, which may be extra strong because it tastes young. Cardamom and vanilla come to mind. It’s a very pleasant wine that I think would do especially well with a heavy meat. Perhaps with some time to age, it would be really, really great.
