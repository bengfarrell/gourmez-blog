**Trellis Cabernet Sauvignon 2005**

_Other words on the label:_ Sonoma County

The wine is almost brown in color.  It smells delicious, like fruit being grilled over a mesquite flame.  The taste is a combination of molasses, peach, and a rich cherry undertone.  With smokiness in every sip, it's definitely a wine worth drinking.
