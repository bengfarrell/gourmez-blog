**Lost Sonnet Meritage 2007** Napa Valley, CA

This is a blend of cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc, and merlot. One sip at the Trader Joe’s tasting table, and I was sold on it being worth the $9.99 (hey, that’s expensive for TJ’s wine!). The nose is very appealing, with a scent of warmed spices and vanilla candles in a lush, rich, berry sauce. From the sip, I learn it’s full-bodied and it reminds me a lot of potpourri. The vanilla notes mix together pretty well with the date and chewy fruit. Some shortbread flavors come in, too, and then tobacco. There is a lot going on in this glass.

It needs some airing—otherwise, it gets a little too close to tasting like potpourri—but it’s quite lovely once it has a chance to settle.

[Beards and Bellies](http://beardsandbellies.com/2011/04/25/lost-sonnet-meritage-2007-napa-valley-red-wine/)

Prevalent raspberry and dark chocolate, with hints of vanilla, coffee, and oak on the nose.  The flavors stay true to the aroma, revealing lots of layers to dig into and ponder. A gorgeous balance of fruit accentuated by chocolate, vanilla, spice, and espresso. Silky tannins provide just enough texture to buttress the flavors without overpowering them. Incredibly smooth, but deceivingly rich. Ridiculously delicious.

[TJ’s Wine Notes](http://tjswinenotes.com/2011/05/03/lost-sonnet-2007-meritage-napa-valley/)

_Color:_ Fairly rich/dense strawberry, plum hue.

_Nose:_ Quite fragrant berry preserves, vanilla, smokiness, little herbaceous, some wood and baking spices.

_Palate:_ Pretty decent tannins quickly dry your mouth, then a layer of dried berries followed by coco, vanilla, little herby, spiciness and moderate acidity to the finish, which really begins to fall flat after about eight-seconds.

[Wine Know Sips](http://residentwineknow.blogspot.com/2011/05/lost-sonnet-meritage-2007.html)

This wine is definitely impressive. Those of you who do not like wines with lots of tannins beware. It has a nice bite to it. Nose of currant, pine, plum, oak, cherry, and bourbon vanilla. Flavors of spicy oak, cocoa, barbecued blackberry, dark chocolate and cranberry. This wine has a peppery mid pallet with dry tannins that mellow into a finish of unsweetened cocoa, coffee and cranberries.
