I have another product review for you guys this week! One thing most foodies have in common is a love of variety. [Love With Food](https://lovewithfood.com/shop) is a company that offers just that for organic and/or all-natural snack foods with a changing selection of goodies delivered every month.

Love With Food gave me a tasting box for review, which is their smallest subscription option. It comes with 8 or more snack items and retails at $10 per month. Bigger snackers can choose the Deluxe box with twice as many snacks for $17, and there is a gluten-free-only option at $24.50 per month.

Now, as you can see, those snacks aren’t exactly gifted in large quantities.

So you should really think of Love With Food as more of a sampler pack than a month’s supply of snack items. But you can purchase many of their items in larger quantities at [Love With Food’s store](https://lovewithfood.com/shop) once you’ve tried them and liked them. My box came with coupons for two of the snack items, and every box order comes with additional bonus points that can be redeemed in the store. Plus, Love With Food offers a bonus feel-good donation of 1 meal to a food bank for every tasting box and 2 for the deluxe and gluten-free boxes. Many of the companies whose products are shipped have charitable pledges of their own as well.

I valiantly sampled each and every offering in my tasting box, most recently the Desert Gardens Spinach Dip Mix, a satisfying veggie dip currently providing a swimming pool for my diving carrots. The sour cream and mayo were not included with the mix.

The 180 Degree Nutty Rice Bites with Blueberries oddly didn’t list blueberries in its ingredient list, though the taste of them was strong.

I guess they must have been one of the “natural flavors.” The Zante currants, pumpkin seeds, cashews, almonds, and sesame seeds combined with puffed rice were fun to eat but ultimately too sweet for my taste buds. I think their three different types of sugar may be two too many.

The Skeeter Nut Free Cinnamon Grahams are sure to be any allergy-adverse parent’s dream, although I found the strong taste of canola an odd choice.

[![Love_With_Food_005](http://www.rebeccagomezfarrell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Love_With_Food_005-500x332.jpg)](http://www.rebeccagomezfarrell.com/2014/11/love-with-food-product-review/love_with_food_005/)

But I appreciated the treats’ light sweetness.

The packaging for Terre Di Puglia’s Tarallino Snack with EVOO informed me that tarallinos are a traditional Italian snack and my taste buds informed me they’re made with a pleasing olive oil aftertaste that became addictive fast.

[![Love_With_Food_002](http://www.rebeccagomezfarrell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Love_With_Food_002-332x500.jpg)](http://www.rebeccagomezfarrell.com/2014/11/love-with-food-product-review/love_with_food_002/)

I love that they recall the heft and texture of those hard Bavarian pretzels I used to gum at as a child.

The first standout of the box, for me, was the great selection of teas from Revolution Tea, including their Honeybush Caramel, Southern Mint, and Tropical Green.

[![Love_With_Food_006](http://www.rebeccagomezfarrell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Love_With_Food_006-500x466.jpg)](http://www.rebeccagomezfarrell.com/2014/11/love-with-food-product-review/love_with_food_006/)

Those leaves unfurl fast! The tropical green tea’s tropical elements were just a suggestion of flavor, which I loved. I can’t stand it when tea companies overwhelm the actual tea with fruit infusions (Celestial Seasonings, I’m looking at you).

The second standout, and probably my favorite of the bunch, was Vintage Italia’s Marinara Pasta Chips.

[![Love_With_Food_004](http://www.rebeccagomezfarrell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Love_With_Food_004-500x332.jpg)](http://www.rebeccagomezfarrell.com/2014/11/love-with-food-product-review/love_with_food_004/)

They were simply fantastic. Why pasta chips? Because they’re made with durum semolina wheat flour, the flour most commonly used to make pasta. It’s also commonly sprinkled on baked goods, including pizza crusts, to provide a satisfying crunch and that gritty texture is what makes these chips stand out. The flavors also provided an excellent approximation of a marinara sauce.

I think Love With Food boxes would make fantastic gifts for foodies…and hey, would you look at that? It’s almost the holiday season! Having the box appear once a month unbidden would put a smile right on my face, though I’m not sure I’d buy it for myself. But as a gift? That whole new set of foods to sample would be a delight.

If you have foodie friends like me on your Christmas list, consider getting them a subscription. The good news? If you enroll in the next 12 days using this link ([https://lovewithfood.com/freetrial?code=GOURMEZ](https://lovewithfood.com/freetrial?code=GOURMEZ)), the first box is free minus a $2 shipping and handling charge! Like it? Stay enrolled and keep the snacks coming. Don’t like it? Cancel, no harm no foul. If you’re giving it as a gift, your friend doesn’t even have to know you didn’t pay for the first one! You sly devil, you.

Let me know if you give Love With Food a try. I’d love to know what you think.
