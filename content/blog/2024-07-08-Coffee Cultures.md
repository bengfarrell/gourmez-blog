## The Scoop on Coffee Cultures

*Address:*\
1926 Park Street\
Alameda, CA\
*Website:* <https://coffee-cultures.com/>\
*Phone:* 510.865.0992

I’ve passed this café many times on my way into Alameda. Its modern aesthetic and bold signage always catches my eye as I exit the Park Street bridge. With a few hours between lunch and dinner dates in the East Bay, I finally had my chance to try it out!

Per the website, this café was opened by a true coffee-loving local. That coffee love extends to loving the cultures around coffee drinking all around the globe. The Alameda Coffee Cultures is one of two shops currently in operation by the same owner.

It appears that fancy toasts are a café specialty, but I had just ate, so I did not sample one on this trip. My fave combination of flavors, orange and coffee, also appeared twice on the short coffee menu, which I highly approve of.

## My Take on Coffee Cultures

*The Vibe:* This café is full of sunshine and modern white, black, and gold accent colors. The window wall consists of a long bar with wooden barstools that look comfy ... but only remain comfy for about half an hour. Also inside is a handful of happy potted plants, and four tables with wicker chairs. There’s an impressive patio in the courtyard as well, but it was not open on this rainy day.

Side note: Sitting at the bar provided interesting people watching as it’s located right on a busy intersection, with traffic headed into Oakland.

*Can I Work There*? Sure can! On a Friday afternoon, the café was about half-full, so I did not feel like I was taking up precious space. I did not scope out the outlet situation, though. Wifi is free.

*The Drinks:* Of course I went for the orange espresso tonic soda, which consists of orange syrup, espresso, and tonic water. I recommend letting the dehydrated orange rind soften in the soda, so you can take bites to up the orange quotient—the syrup is not strongly flavored. That also means it’s not overly sweet, which is a plus to me. But I’d have liked more orange presence overall.

*Will I Go Back?* For sure, especially on an afternoon when that large patio is open. I may find a coffee drink I enjoy more than the orange espresso tonic on the menu, and comfier chairs would be a plus.
