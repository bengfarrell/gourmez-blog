**Pomegranate Lychee Martini** Revolution (Downtown Durham) [Website](http://www.revolutionrestaurant.com/Revolution_Durham/Menus.html) $10

![](http://www.thegourmez.com/gourmez/photos/Pomegranate Lychee Martini.jpg)

This attractive drink is made with vodka, pomegranate molasses, and lychee juice. The whole lychee garnish is a great touch. The flavor is very light but nice, with the lychee taking the lead role. Other than a flash of pomegranate, the molasses mainly adds texture to the drink.Â  The combination of ingredients is such that each element merely suggests its presence, which lends the drink a nice subtlety overall, but it could use a little more pizazz.
