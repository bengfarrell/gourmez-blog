## The 411 on Eon Coffee

![eon coffee sign](https://thegourmez-wpmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/2025/3/eon-coffee+(5).jpg)

*Address:* 24970 Hesperian Boulevard\
Hayward, CA\
*Website:* <https://www.eoncoffee.com/>

*The Vibe:* Eon Coffee is located in an appealing stone and wood building across the street from Chabot College, which supplies a sizable portion of their patrons.

There's indoor and outdoor seating, and you can find an outlet inside most of the time—score! Eon Coffee has suffered from vandalism and break-ins, so their doors seem to be permanently plywood now, but they are painted an appealing blue that makes me feel welcome. I also appreciate that they stay open until late afternoon, though of course, I'd prefer evenings, too.

Eon has a modest health and wellness bent. Though they offer standard espresso drinks with sugary syrups, I appreciate their lighter and less sweet options, too. That includes the Latte Love, which uses a milk-based, less sweet syrup in a variety of flavors.

Eon Coffee also sells GreeNoodle moroheiya ramen noodle packets. The noodles are made from the moroheiya plant and wheat flour, which offers more fiber than typical ramen noodles, and they are air-dried rather than fried. Mulberry tea is also a favorite here for health properties—look those up on their website.

Eon roasts their own coffee beans offsite and sells them whole bean. A long smoothie list is available. Make sure to check out the Dutch iced coffee brewer that Eon displays right by the register!

That cold process involves a slow infusion of coffee overnight, and it produces less acidic iced coffee. I love that they actually put the machine to good use and don't just have it on display.

Eon sells grab-n-go sandwiches, wraps, and salads from their display case, and they also make paninis in house. Bagels, pastries, and desserts are available, though they do sell out.

*Wi-Fi*: Eon Coffee offers free wi-fi to customers, but it's not always reliable. Bring your own portal, just in case.

## My Take on Eon Coffee

*The Food & Drink:* Eon's baristas hit the mark for your standard lattes, mochas, and drip coffees. I like that many of them, when ordered to stay, come with a little sugar cookie as well.

What a cute extra touch! That beverage is the cacao cappuccino, one of those "slighter lighter" options I mentioned above—they add brown sugar and cocoa powder to the cappuccino, but you don't get that full overwhelm of a sugary mocha syrup. Instead, the cappuccino offers a touch of chocolate lusciousness. I recommend it.

Seasonal options are also always available, which included cherry blossom and Irish cream lattes on this visit.

Small sizes come with two shots, which makes me happy. I also like that Dutch iced coffee.

Either the process used or the beans highlight the nuttier notes of the coffee, reminding me of a woodsy, rich Brazil nut. It's a unique taste.

As for food, I've had the tuna (with cheddar, tomato, and dill), turkey (with pesto, Swiss, tomato, and red onion), and chipotle chicken (with provolone, garlicky chicken, tomato, and sauce) panini options and they do hit the spot!

The paninis are greasier than you may expect for a "healthy" coffeehouse, but that's no problem for me. The bread usually has a nice crunch, too.

*Would I Go Back?* Yes, and I will soon! This café produces the right amount of background noise to spur my writing, so I appreciate that. The coffee is solid, too. It's a great option for working. And I've honestly never tried a sandwich or salad from the display case, so I need to give those a go.
