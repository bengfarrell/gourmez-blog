# The 411 on Drake’s Barrel House

I was a fan of [Drake’s Dealership](https://drinkdrakes.com/places/dealership/) from their very early days, having been first introduced to the restaurant and brewery on [a media tour](https://thegourmez.com/blog/2015-11-20-take-a-virtual-tour-of-the-hive-oakland/) shortly after they opened. It’s a beautiful space with a large patio with fire pits and table service, plenty of indoor seating for cooler nights, and a party vibe. They offer great pizza and an inventive menu of salads and small plates.

Moving somewhat south in 2021 meant that Drake’s Barrel House in San Leandro is now my closer option to visit a Drake’s Brewing Co. location. The Barrel House is where their main brewery is located, and it feels more like a brewery than the Dealership, with its cavernous warehouse space.

Drake’s Barrel House is relaxed, with plenty of nooks to hide away from others if you’re trying to do some work and an abundance of large tables if you’re there to meet friends. They also have board games and a pinball machine or two.

Order inside at the bar, where a small menu is available in addition to the taps.

The Barrel House has a patio, but it’s more rustic than at the Dealership and wraps around the brewery building. Don’t forget to bring a sweater! The patio is full of sunshine, but there’s almost always a chilly breeze coming up from the Bay.

An important note: The Barrel House is tucked away **behind** the Westgate Center strip mall, which houses a Walmart, Home Depot, See’s Candies, and more. You will not find it if you can see those storefronts. Instead, you must turn onto the surface roads off Westgate Parkway or Davis Street and circle behind the main buildings.

# My Take on Drake’s Barrel House

*The Beer:* Flights are available in addition to a healthy 20+ taps. Usually, that includes a barleywine or two, and maybe a stout, if I’m lucky. The dark beers tend to be experimental and involve barrel aging, which I’m still honestly not sold on for beer. But they have a few that keep me happy.

I can recommend the herbaceous Santa’s Brass: barley wine aged in whiskey and port barrels. Also the Death of the Sun, a bourbon barrel-aged imperial stout with gravitas. I’m glad Drake’s continues to produce dark beers, even if I’d like just a milk stout myself. There are usually plenty of IPAs, pilsners, sours, and the like for all y’all who prefer lighter styles.

*The Food:* The menu leans heavily on fancy tater tots, with all the makings of a loaded baked potato. My favorite is the dirty tots with bacon, pulled pork, sweet & spicy cherry peppers, and green onions.

You’ll need a fork and some napkins to dig in. The Barrel House also offers a range of standard sandwiches—think BLT, Cubano, and pulled pork—and a handful of burgers and salads.

The BLT’s bacon was less crispy than I prefer, but it hits the nostalgia sweet spot with that grilled white bread and combination of classic ingredients.

*Would I Go Back?* Of course. Not only is Drake’s Barrel House a great space for hanging out with friends, but it’s also set up nicely for my husband and I to spend an afternoon on our laptops, working on our own projects. Satisfying food is available if I want a snack, and the beer is interesting to try, even if I’d like more that suited my particular tastes. But that’s true of any brewery—I am just not the average American beer drinker, alas. Still, I expect we’ll be back here time and time again.
