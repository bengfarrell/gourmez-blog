**Jacob's Creek Reserve Shiraz** Other words on the label: Vintage 2004

Pleasantly earthy and lightly peppery as well. It doesn't taste like a watermelon but for some reason, I can't get the image of a thick, juicy slice out of my mind. There's a floral element as well, like a few drops of liquid lavender were added.

Full-bodied and delicious.
