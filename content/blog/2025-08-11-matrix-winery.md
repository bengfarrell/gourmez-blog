# The 411 on Matrix Winery

Matrix Winery is located on a beautiful property just outside of Healdsburg in northern Sonoma County. Like many of the wineries in this region, pinot noir is a specialty of theirs, but zinfandel and chardonnay are also strong contenders. I was a member for the last three years, and each bottle was quality.

*The Vibe:* One of the reasons I joined Matrix’s wine club is how much I love their outdoor patio and its view. I picked the winery at random out of many options offering an affordable tasting, when I was on a [writing residency](https://www.writingbetweenthevines.org/) at Moshin Vineyards.

If it’s not too busy, you can faintly hear the water fountains at Matrix Winery’s entrance bubbling from the patio. The trees growing up through the patio contribute to a magical feel.

 But so does that view! Of course, many spots in the Russian River Valley boast similar sights, but this particular lake at this particular winery made the tasting feel more intimate, a special treat.

Matrix Winery also has indoor tables for rainy or cold days, but choose the patio if you can.

# My Take on Matrix Winery

*The Wine:* I already shared that I joined their wine club, so that spoils how I feel about Matrix’s wines—they’re great! 

The grapes are grown in estate vineyards, or sourced from Dry Creek Valley and the coast. Prices typically range from \$40–\$70 per bottle, but wine club members get great discounts on six or twelve bottles, one of the reasons I made the leap.

Differences between vineyards and vintages are clear in the glass, and none of the wines I’ve tried over the years have too much alcohol bite or taste sharp, even when opened young.

On my most recent visit, I went home with two bottles of their pinot noir rosé—a solid, refreshing pick for any warm day—and a 50% petit sirah, 50% zinfandel blend that I found a lovely mix on my tongue. The tasting itself focuses on 100% pinot noir and zinfandel bottlings, but don’t hesitate to ask if you want to try something else. You may discover a gem like I did on this most recent trip.

*The Grounds:* I wandered Matrix Winery’s grounds after my first tasting and admired the grapevines in the nearest fields.

A smaller pond presented more picturesque scenery. I could have spent a couple pleasant hours there reading. I wish there were hiking trails.

But this is a working vineyard, of course, and the beauty I could see from that short walk around the tasting room area was enough to enjoy. There are bocci courts in front of the main building, and I think cornhole, too, if you’re looking to linger longer.

*Would I Go Back for a \$25 tasting?* By wine country standards, a \$25 tasting is quite affordable.

With a magnificent view and even better wines? It’s worth the price, whether or not you decide to waive it away by buying two or more bottles to take home or joining the wine club. Plus, Matrix Winery is part of the [Wilson Artisan Wines](https://wilsonartisanwines.com/) group, so a membership entitles you to free tasting benefits at a number of other local wineries. That makes a wine country visit much more doable financially.
