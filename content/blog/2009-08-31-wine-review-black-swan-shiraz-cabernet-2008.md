Wine: **Black Swan Shiraz Cabernet 2008** Region: Southeastern Australia

This wine's nose is like a warmed mulberry potpourri. It tastes of bright blackberries that have been spiced with cardamom and cinnamon.Â  Other than the slight kick at the end, I thought it was intriguing, enjoyable, and paired very well with monterey jack.
