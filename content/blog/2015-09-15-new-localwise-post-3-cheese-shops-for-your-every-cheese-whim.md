In case you missed it, my next post is now live at the Localwise community blog! [This one is on cheese shop](https://www.localwisejobs.com/blog/3-cheese-shops-for-fulfilling-your-every-cheese-whim/)s in the Elmwood, Temescal, and Rockridge neighborhoods, which just so happen to be the closest neighborhoods to me...okay, they are conveniently the closest neighborhoods to me. I am blessed with amazing cheese options within walking distance of my abode and I am never, ever complaining.

Here's your teaser:

> Perhaps the tastiest of all North Oakland’s and South Berkeley’s gourmet food stores are the cheese shops. Doling out wedges and wheels of this glorious dairy product pleases customers and employees alike. As Juliana Uruburu, cheese program director at Rockridge’s [Market Hall Foods](http://markethallfoods.com/cheese-charcuterie/cheese) puts it, “We give people the gift of cheese, helping them discover their own palates and the world of cheese at the same time. We make people happy all day, every day.” Sounds like a recipe for employee satisfaction that should get the Real California Cheese seal of approval.

And because I have a plethora of cheesy photos that didn't make it into the post, I hope these images entice you over to check out the article on [cheesy goodness in Oakland and Berkeley.](https://www.localwisejobs.com/blog/3-cheese-shops-for-fulfilling-your-every-cheese-whim/)
