**Wine:** Cribari Cellars California Madeira **Region:** California

This is my first madeira, which I accidentally bought instead of marsala for a recipe. My quick googling informs me that Madeira is a fortified sherry wine with some Muscatel thrown in and is used as a dessert and cooking wine. It's heated up to reproduce oxidation that it would receive from a long voyage overseas. Crazy.

It smells like sherry, but has a reddish sheen as compared to the more typical amber of sherries. This gives me hope I might like it as I'm rather sick of sherry at present. It also smells like a warmed fruit and brandy sauce, maybe peach.

The taste is much better than the sherries I've had, luckily. The alcohol punch is there but not too strong, and it's less syrupy in texture. It tickles my tongue a little. When drinking, the taste is closer to apricot than the peach I smelled. There's a lot of caramel and a little green apple and vanilla.

This is a wine with a lot of flavors and I'd take it over a regular sherry anyday. Port is still the winner in the dessert category, however.
