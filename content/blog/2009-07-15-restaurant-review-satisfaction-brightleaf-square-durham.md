**Satisfaction Restaurant and Bar** 905 W Main Street Suite 37 Brightleaf Square, Durham [http://www.satisfactionrestaurant.com](http://www.satisfactionrestaurant.com/)

Sandwiches and Salads:  $5.29-8.99. Pizza:  Starting at $8.59 for a small, plain cheese.

On a Sunday afternoon, Satisfaction is a relaxing sports bar and grill.  I specify when we ate because I've been here for a drink on a game night and the vibe is completely different, much louder and younger, as to be expected.  It has a large, open, wood and brick interior with sports paraphernalia, plenty of huge televisions, and a couple of cars coming out of the walls.

There's also outdoor seating available.

The menu was your typical selection of sub sandwiches, burgers, and pizzas.  I had a Club Sub with turkey, bacon, shredded lettuce, tomatoes, and mayonnaise held together in a simple white bread roll.

It tasted just as it should, with a good amount of flavor coming from the bacon and mayo.  It came with a side of their Satisfaction Sauce, which is their house ranch dressing.  For an extra $1, chips or fries can be added on.  I can recommend the chips as they were homemade, thick cut, and a bit chewy.  It's always fun to take a break from thin, crispy chips.

For the price, I had no complaints.  I'd come again.
